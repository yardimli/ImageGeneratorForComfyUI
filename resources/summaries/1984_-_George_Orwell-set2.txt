Summary
In 1984, civilization has been devastated by world war, civil war and revolution. The province of Airstrip One, formerly known as Great Britain, is part of Oceania, one of three totalitarian superpowers that control the entire world. Under the leadership of "The Party", ruled by the ideology of "Ingsoc" (a neologism for "English Socialism") and the mysterious "Big Brother", the region is dominated. The Party mercilessly suppresses any resistance, deploys the thought police and monitors the population through telescreens, cameras and hidden microphones. Anyone who opposes the Party is eliminated, and all traces of their existence are erased.
Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party in London, is employed by the Ministry of Truth. There he alters historical documents to make them conform to the ever-changing official history of the state. He edits old editions of the Times while the originals fall through the so-called memory holes into a giant furnace and are destroyed. Despite his outward loyalty, Winston secretly dislikes the Party and dreams of an uprising. He is aware that he is already a "thought criminal".
In the proletarian quarter, he meets Mr. Charrington, an antique dealer, from whom he buys a diary. In this diary, Winston records his criticism of the Party and Big Brother. He is shocked to discover that the proles have no political awareness. While working at the Ministry of Truth, he meets Julia, a young woman whom he believes to be a spy. He feels strong hatred towards her. He also suspects that his superior, senior party official O'Brien, may be a member of a secret resistance group known as the Brotherhood, founded by Big Brother's hated political opponent Emmanuel Goldstein.
In an unexpected moment, Julia presents Winston with a secret love letter, and the two develop a forbidden love affair. Despite her dislike of the Party, Winston realizes that Julia is politically indifferent and has no intention of overthrowing the system. Their meetings begin in remote country locations and continue in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's store. During their time together, Winston reflects on the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and on his difficult relationship with his estranged wife Katharine.
A few weeks into their affair, O'Brien invites Winston to his home. There he reveals himself to be a member of the secret fraternity and sends Winston a book by Emmanuel Goldstein entitled "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism." Meanwhile, during national Hate Week, Oceania's enemy abruptly changes from Eurasia to Eastasia, a change that is barely noticed. Winston is summoned to the Ministry to help revise the relevant documents.
Winston and Julia study parts of Goldstein's book together, which explains the Party's techniques for maintaining power, the true meaning of its slogans, and the idea of perpetual war. The book claims that a proletarian uprising could topple the Party. However, Winston never gets the chance to read the chapter that explains why the Party is so determined to maintain control.
Winston and Julia are lured into a trap and arrested when it is revealed that Mr. Charrington is in fact a member of the Thought Police. They are taken to the Ministry of Love, where O'Brien reveals himself to be another agent of the Thought Police. O'Brien reveals that he and other party members have written Goldstein's book, leaving Winston in the dark as to whether the Brotherhood really exists. In the months that follow, Winston is tortured and starved in order to expose his thoughts and beliefs to the party.
In the final phase of re-education, Winston is taken to Room 101, where each prisoner is confronted with his worst fear. In Winston's case, it is a cage with angry rats. Faced with this horror vision, he betrays Julia and swears to be loyal to the Party.
After his release, Winston regularly returns to the Chestnut Tree café. One day he meets Julia there again, who has also been tortured. They both confess that they betrayed each other during the torture and realize that their love for each other has died out. While Winston is sitting in the café, a supposed great victory of Oceania over the Eurasian forces in Africa is announced on the news. Winston finally feels that he not only accepts but loves Big Brother.
