Set against the backdrop of World War II, the story centers on the intense and complicated friendship between two prep school roommates, Gene Forrester and Phineas (Finny).

Summary
Fifteen years after graduating, Gene Forrester returns to the Devon School, an exclusive prep school in New England. He revisits two key locations: the First Building and a tall tree by the river. The narrative then flashes back to the summer of 1942. The 16-year-old Gene is a rule-following, studious boy, while his best friend and roommate, Finny, is a charismatic, rebellious, and gifted athlete. Finny coaxes Gene and other boys into forming "The Super Suicide Society of the Summer Session," which involves jumping from a high branch of the tree into the Devon River. Finny's charm allows him to get away with breaking school rules, such as wearing a pink shirt and using the school tie as a belt, which Gene both envies and resents. During one jump, Gene loses his balance, and Finny saves him, an act that complicates Gene's feelings further.

The boys' friendship deepens, but so does Gene's inner turmoil. Finny invents a new, chaotic sport called "blitzball" and persuades Gene to skip studying for a forbidden bike ride to the beach. There, Finny confesses that Gene is his best friend, an emotional revelation that makes the more reserved Gene uncomfortable. After this trip, Gene fails a trigonometry test and begins to suspect that Finny is deliberately trying to sabotage his academic success so that he remains the superior one in their friendship. One evening, as they are about to jump from the tree together, Gene, acting on a "blind impulse," jounces the limb. Finny loses his balance and falls to the bank, shattering his leg.

Finny's athletic career is over. Consumed by guilt, Gene tries to confess to Finny in the infirmary, but Finny is too sedated to understand. Later, Gene visits Finny at his home near Boston and confesses again, but Finny angrily refuses to believe his friend could have intentionally harmed him. Back at Devon for the fall term, Gene tries to atone by giving up sports, but Finny, in a phone call, insists that Gene must play sports for him. When Finny returns to Devon on crutches, he and Gene create a "separate peace," denying the reality of the war and focusing on training Gene for the "1944 Olympics." Their fragile peace is disrupted by the enlistment and subsequent mental breakdown of their quiet, nature-loving classmate, Leper Lepellier, who returns from the army after witnessing the horrors of war.

The tension culminates when a jealous classmate, Brinker Hadley, organizes a mock trial in the school's assembly hall to "investigate" the truth of Finny's accident. A terrified and unstable Leper is brought in as a witness and confirms that he saw Gene shake the limb. Devastated by the truth, Finny rushes out of the room, falls down a flight of marble stairs, and breaks his leg again. The next day, Gene and Finny have a final, quiet conversation in the infirmary. Finny admits he has been denying the war because he can't participate, and Gene assures him that his action at the tree was a blind, thoughtless impulse, not an act of hatred. Later that day, during the routine surgery to set the bone, a piece of bone marrow enters Finny's bloodstream and stops his heart, killing him. Gene feels as though he is attending his own funeral and realizes that his own personal war, the one fought at Devon, has ended with Finny's death.
