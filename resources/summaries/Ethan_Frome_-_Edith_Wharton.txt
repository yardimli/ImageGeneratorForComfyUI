The arrival of Zeena's vibrant young cousin, Mattie Silver, ignites a forbidden love in Ethan, leading to a desperate act with lifelong repercussions.

Summary
The story is framed by the experiences of an unnamed narrator, an engineer sent to work near the town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, in the early 1900s. He becomes intrigued by a local man, Ethan Frome, a 52-year-old who appears much older, marked by a severe limp and a red gash on his forehead. The narrator learns from locals that Ethan was injured in a "smash-up" 24 years earlier, but details are scarce. After a horse epidemic forces the narrator to hire Ethan for daily transport, he gets a glimpse into Ethan's quiet, frustrated intelligence. One night, a severe snowstorm forces the narrator to take shelter at the Frome farm. Upon entering the house, he hears a woman's whining voice, and it is this experience that allows him to piece together the tragic story of Ethan Frome.

The main narrative flashes back 24 years. The young Ethan Frome, once an aspiring engineer, was forced to abandon his studies to run the family farm after his father's death. After his mother also died, a lonely Ethan married his cousin Zenobia "Zeena" Pierce, who had come to care for her. Soon after the marriage, Zeena became silent, sickly, and a constant complainer, trapping Ethan in a miserable, isolated existence.

Their lives change with the arrival of Mattie Silver, Zeena's orphaned cousin, who comes to help with the housework. Ethan is immediately drawn to the beautiful and lively Mattie, and his affection for her grows during their shared moments, particularly their walks home from town events. One winter evening, after a church social, Ethan walks Mattie home. They pass a dangerous sledding hill where a young couple recently had a near-fatal crash against a large elm tree. Ethan promises to take Mattie sledding there. Back at the house, they find Zeena has locked them out, and her gaunt, suspicious presence shatters the evening's magic.

The next day, Zeena announces she is traveling to a new doctor in a nearby town, leaving Ethan and Mattie alone for the evening. Ethan is euphoric, and he and Mattie share a quiet, domestic supper that feels like a glimpse of the life they could have together. The evening is marred when the cat, a symbol of Zeena's presence, knocks over and shatters Zeena's prized red pickle dish, which Mattie had used for the special occasion. Despite the tension, a deep, unspoken connection flows between them, though Ethan cannot bring himself to kiss her.

Zeena returns the next day, announcing that her health is worse than ever and that she has hired a new, more efficient girl to replace Mattie, who is to be sent away immediately. Devastated, Ethan finally kisses Mattie passionately and vows not to let her go. However, his attempts to secure money to run away with her fail, and he feels utterly trapped by his poverty and his duty to Zeena.

Resigned to their fate, Ethan insists on driving Mattie to the train station himself. On the way, they stop at the sledding hill and, in a moment of shared despair, Mattie suggests they sled down the hill and crash into the elm tree, so they can die together rather than be separated. Ethan, seeing no other escape from his sterile life with Zeena, agrees. As they hurtle down the hill, Ethan has a vision of Zeena's face, and they crash into the tree.

The story returns to the present, with the narrator in the Frome kitchen. He sees two women: one is the older, gray-faced Zeena, and the other is a paralyzed, whining figure huddled in a chairâ€”Mattie. The narrator later learns from a local woman, Mrs. Ned Hale, that after the "smash-up," Zeena miraculously regained her health and has spent the last 24 years caring for the two invalids. The accident transformed the once-vibrant Mattie into a bitter, complaining shrew, much like Zeena. The three are now trapped together in the cold, silent farmhouse, living a life that Mrs. Hale describes as indistinguishable from death, noting there is little difference between "the Fromes up at the farm and the Fromes down in the graveyard."
