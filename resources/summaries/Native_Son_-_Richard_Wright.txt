Native Son
Richard Wright

"Native Son" by Richard Wright is a powerful and brutal protest novel that chronicles the life of Bigger Thomas, a young Black man living in poverty on Chicago's South Side. Trapped by systemic racism and his own fear, Bigger's life takes a dramatic and tragic turn when he accidentally murders a young white woman, an act that paradoxically gives him a sense of identity and power for the first time. The novel is a stark examination of the devastating effects of racial oppression and the violence that can erupt from a life denied freedom and choice.

Summary

The story is divided into three parts: "Fear," "Flight," and "Fate."

Book 1: Fear
The novel opens in a cramped, one-room apartment on Chicago’s South Side, where Bigger Thomas lives with his mother, Mrs. Thomas, his brother, Buddy, and his sister, Vera. Their morning is disrupted by a large black rat, which Bigger violently kills with a skillet. The rat symbolizes the death and decay of their environment, and Bigger's brutal killing of it foreshadows his own capacity for violence and his eventual fate of being cornered like a terrified animal. Bigger is sullen and filled with a deep-seated hatred for the white world that makes him feel inadequate and humiliated. His mother, a deeply religious woman, clings to the church for solace, while his sister Vera is paralyzed by fear, and his brother Buddy admires Bigger but is willing to remain submissive to society.

Later, Bigger meets with his gang—G.H., Gus, and Jack. They fantasize about the lives of white people and plan to rob a delicatessen owned by a white man, Mr. Blum. The prospect of confronting a white person fills Bigger with an overwhelming fear. To avoid the robbery without losing face, he picks a fight with Gus, accusing him of cowardice and threatening him with a knife. This act of violence releases some of Bigger's pent-up tension.

To avoid having his family's relief aid cut off, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons, a wealthy white family. Mr. Dalton is a real estate tycoon who gives money to Black colleges and the NAACP, yet he is also the owner of the company that charges exorbitant rent for the rat-infested tenement in which Bigger's family lives. The Daltons, particularly the blind Mrs. Dalton, are symbolic of a white society that believes it is doing good but is fundamentally blind to the suffering it causes.

Bigger's first task is to drive the Daltons' daughter, Mary, a self-indulgent young woman who considers herself a liberal. She insists Bigger pick up her lover, Jan Erlone, a Communist. Both Mary and Jan try to befriend Bigger, shaking his hand, drinking with him, and insisting he eat with them. Their patronizing attempts to cross racial lines only confuse and anger Bigger, who is used to a rigid social code of subservience. After dropping Jan off, Bigger helps a very drunk Mary to her bedroom. Overcome by the proximity to a white woman—a major social taboo—he kisses her. At that moment, the blind Mrs. Dalton enters the room. Terrified of being discovered, Bigger presses a pillow over Mary's face to keep her quiet. When Mrs. Dalton leaves, Bigger realizes he has accidentally smothered Mary to death. In a panic, he carries her body to the basement, severs her head so she will fit, and burns her in the furnace.

Book 2: Flight
The murder transforms Bigger. For the first time, he feels alive and powerful, believing he has created a new identity for himself by committing an act of his own will. He sees his family and friends as "blind" for not understanding the world as he now does. He decides to frame Jan for the crime, knowing the Daltons and the police are prejudiced against Communists. The family hires a private investigator, Mr. Britten, but Bigger outsmarts him by playing the role of a humble, ignorant Black man.

Emboldened, Bigger writes a ransom note, demanding $10,000 from the Daltons and signing it from the "Reds." He involves his girlfriend, Bessie Mears, a woman who, like Bigger, uses alcohol and sex to escape the harshness of her life. The plan unravels when reporters, stoking the furnace in the Dalton basement, discover Mary's bones and an earring. Bigger panics and flees.

He takes Bessie with him to an abandoned tenement building. Realizing she knows too much and cannot be trusted, he brutally murders her with a brick as she sleeps and throws her body down an air shaft. Now a double murderer, Bigger is hunted by thousands of police and volunteers who terrorize the Black community in their search. His flight across the rooftops of the South Side ends when he is cornered. The police spray him with a powerful fire hose, and he is captured and taken to prison.

Book 3: Fate
In jail, Bigger withdraws, refusing to speak or eat. He is visited by his mother's minister, who gives him a wooden cross, a symbol of a Christianity Bigger cannot accept. Jan Erlone also visits, bringing with him Boris A. Max, a white Communist lawyer who agrees to defend Bigger. Jan, having realized his own blindness to Bigger's reality, accepts some of the blame for what happened.

During the trial, the prosecutor, Mr. Buckley, portrays Bigger as an ape-like rapist and killer. Max, in his defense, does not call any witnesses. Instead, he delivers a long, eloquent speech arguing that Bigger is a product of centuries of oppression. He contends that white society is guilty of creating the conditions—the fear, the poverty, the lack of opportunity—that made Bigger's crimes inevitable. He warns that if society continues to deny Black people their humanity, more violence will follow.

Max's speech is ignored. Bigger is found guilty and sentenced to die in the electric chair. On his way back to his cell, he sees a Ku Klux Klan cross burning in the distance. The sight solidifies his rejection of Christianity, and he rips the wooden cross from his neck. In his final days, Bigger struggles to understand the meaning of his life. In a final conversation with Max, he tries to explain that his actions, though horrific, were the only things that ever made him feel truly alive. He tells a shocked Max, "But what I killed for, I am!" Though he will die, Bigger faces his end having forged a terrifying identity for himself, finally reaching out to another human by asking Max to "Tell Jan hello."
