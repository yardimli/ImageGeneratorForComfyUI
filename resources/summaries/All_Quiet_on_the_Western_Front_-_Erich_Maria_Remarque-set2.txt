All Quiet on the Western Front
Erich Maria Remarque


"All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque is one of the most significant anti-war novels ever written. It is based on Remarque's own experiences as a soldier in the First World War and follows the young German soldier Paul Bäumer, who volunteers with his classmates and quickly becomes disillusioned by the horrors of war. The novel vividly portrays the suffering and alienation of the soldiers who have to fight in the trenches and reveals the horrors of the First World War in all its brutality and senselessness.
Summary
The book revolves around Paul Bäumer, a young German soldier serving on the Western Front during the First World War. When war breaks out, Paul is living in a picturesque German village with his family. The passionate and patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek inspire him and his classmates to volunteer for the Imperial Army at the outbreak of war.
During the training period, they meet Himmelstoss and are introduced to various people, including Frisian fishermen and farmers, with whom they soon become friends. Paul and his friends and former schoolmates, including Leer, Müller, Kropp, Kemmerich and others, arrive at the front. Here they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, also known as Kat, an experienced older soldier who becomes Paul's confidant.
Their experiences at the front are characterized by constant fighting and the brutal conditions of trench warfare. They fight for insignificant tracts of land, which are often lost just as quickly as they were won. Remarque describes the surviving soldiers as mentally broken, ageing men who have been internally destroyed by the war.
When Paul has the opportunity to visit his home, the shocking contrast between the war and civilian life becomes apparent. The city is unchanged, but Paul feels alienated and estranged. The war has changed him and he can no longer connect with the people there. His father asks him inappropriate questions about the war, and a former teacher lectures him on war strategies, while claiming that Paul and his friends know nothing about the big picture of the war, but only about their own little sector. In these moments, it becomes clear how far the war has distanced Paul from his former world.
The only real connection that Paul still seems to feel in his homeland is the connection to his seriously ill mother, with whom he maintains a loving but reserved relationship. The night before his departure, he stays awake and shares tender moments and worries with her. He experiences a multitude of feelings and reflects on the tragic distance that has arisen between him and his dying mother. He is tormented by grief and regret over unspoken thoughts and feelings and comes to the conclusion that it was a mistake to go home at all.
On his return to the front, Paul experiences joy at seeing his comrades again. A short time later, he takes part in a patrol and kills a man for the first time in a scuffle. He watches the man die slowly and painfully, which plunges him into deep remorse and despair. He even seeks forgiveness from the man's dead body. His friends Kat and Albert try to reassure him and explain that this is just one facet of the war.
Later, they are given what Paul describes as a "good assignment": They have to guard a supply depot in an evacuated village. During this assignment, they are finally able to eat enough food, a stark contrast to the starvation conditions in the trenches. The men take the opportunity to stock up on supplies and luxury goods, such as fine cigars, from the depot and thus experience a brief relief from the hardships of war.
While evacuating villagers who are considered enemy civilians, Paul and Albert are unexpectedly caught in an artillery attack on their convoy. Both are injured by shrapnel. On the way back by train, Albert's injury worsens so much that he is forced to stay in a Catholic hospital to recover. Paul manages to stay with his friend through clever negotiations and manipulation. Albert's leg has to be amputated, while Paul is deemed fit enough to serve and is sent back to the front.
The war enters its final phase and the German army begins to retreat. Paul has to watch his comrades fall one after the other. The loss of Kat, his mentor, breaks his heart and saps his will to live. In the last chapter of the book, he tells of an imminent peace, but he does not feel hopeful about it. He feels aimless and believes that his generation will be different and misunderstood.
Paul's life finally ends in October 1918 on a day that seems unusually peaceful. The official war report of that day laconically notes that there were no special events on the Western Front. When Paul's dead body is found, there is an expression of calm on his face, as if he is relieved that his ordeal is now over.
