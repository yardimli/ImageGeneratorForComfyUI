Summary
Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish and an expert dynamiter, is fighting for the Republican (Loyalist) side against General Francoâ€™s Fascist army. Under orders from his Russian commander, General Golz, he travels into the Guadarrama mountains to connect with a band of local guerrilla fighters. His mission is to destroy a strategic bridge to prevent Fascist reinforcements from reaching an upcoming battle. His success depends entirely on the cooperation of this guerrilla band.

Upon reaching their cave hideout, Jordan meets the group's leader, Pablo, a once-courageous fighter who has grown weary and cautious, more interested in survival than in risky missions. He also meets Pilar, Pablo's formidable and intuitive gypsy "mujer," who is the true strength of the group, and the beautiful 19-year-old Maria, a refugee whom the partisans rescued after she was brutalized by Fascist soldiers. An immediate and deep attraction forms between Jordan and Maria. Pablo resents Jordan's mission, fearing it will bring destruction upon his people, creating a tension that forces Jordan to consider that he may have to kill the leader to complete his objective.

With an old, reliable partisan named Anselmo, Jordan scouts the bridge, and they discuss the moral weight of killing in wartime. That night, after a tense confrontation with a drunken Pablo, Jordan is visited in his sleeping bag by Maria. The worldly-wise Pilar, having read Jordan's palm and sensed he has little time to live, sent the girl to him, believing his love could help heal her emotional wounds.

The next day, Jordan, Pilar, and Maria trek to the camp of another partisan leader, the brave and dependable El Sordo, to secure more men and horses for the mission. On the way, Pilar vividly recounts the horrific day Pablo led an uprising in their village, beating Fascists to death. El Sordo promises his support. On their return, Jordan and Maria make love in a field of heather, an experience so profound they feel "the earth move." As a wet snow begins to fall that night, El Sordo and his men set out to steal horses, believing the snow will cover their tracks.

The third day begins with disaster. The snow has stopped, leaving El Sordo's tracks visible to a Fascist patrol. Trapped on a hilltop, El Sordo and his men fight bravely but are ultimately annihilated by dive-bombers. The only survivor, a boy named Joaquin, is executed by the Fascist Lieutenant Berrendo. The loss of El Sordo's men and horses is a devastating blow to Jordan's plan. Furthermore, reports from Anselmo, who has been watching the bridge, indicate that the enemy is already aware of the planned Republican offensive and is moving reinforcements. Fearing a futile sacrifice, Jordan sends a messenger through the lines to General Golz, advising him to call off the attack. That night, Maria joins him again, and they dream of a life together in Madrid after the war.

On the morning of the fourth and final day, Jordan wakes to find that Pablo has deserted, taking the detonator and blasting caps, rendering the dynamite useless. Meanwhile, Jordan's urgent message to Golz becomes entangled in military bureaucracy and fails to arrive in time. The mission, now seemingly a suicidal endeavor, must proceed. However, Pablo unexpectedly returns, having had a change of heart and overcome his "weakness." He brings five more men and horses to help. Jordan, in the meantime, has devised a way to detonate the dynamite using hand grenades.

As the attack begins, Pablo bravely holds off an enemy tank while Jordan successfully plants the charges. The bridge is destroyed, but the explosion kills old Anselmo. In the chaotic escape, Pablo murders his new recruits to ensure there are enough horses for his own people. As they flee across exposed terrain, Jordan's horse is struck by a shell, and he is thrown, suffering a severely broken leg.

Knowing he cannot go on, Jordan orders the others to leave him behind. He will act as the rear guard to ensure their escape. In his final moments, in great pain, he reflects on his father's suicide, a model of cowardice, and his grandfather's bravery in the American Civil War. He fights the temptation to take his own life, determined to die a soldier's death. Lying on the pine-needle floor of the forest, he readies his gun and waits for the approaching Fascist patrol, led by Lieutenant Berrendo, feeling his heartbeat against the ground.
