Summary
The novel begins on a June morning in 1923 London, when Clarissa, who has just recovered from an illness, sets off to pick up flowers for a reception she is organizing at her home. On the way, she remembers her former beau Peter Walsh and thinks it would have been a good decision to choose him over her current husband Richard, who is serving at Buckingham Palace. She meets her old friend Hugh Whitbread in the street.
Her musings are interrupted by the roar of a car engine: an important person arrives in Bond Street. Clarissa passes Septimus Warren Smith and his wife Lucrezia, an Italian, who are also walking down the street - and the narrative switches to them. Septimus is a young war veteran suffering from a concussion. The sound of a car interrupting Clarissa's thoughts startles him and brings back bad memories of the death of his friend Evans in the war.
Clarissa returns home and thinks of her childhood friend Sally Seton and their special relationship, during which they even kissed once. Richard is not at home because Lady Bruton has invited him to dinner. Then Clarissa receives a surprise visit from Peter Walsh, who has returned from duty in British India on divorce business. They talk about the present while both reflect on the past: the decisions they made that have shaped their lives today. Clarissa also invites Peter to the evening reception. Elizabeth, Clarissa's 17-year-old daughter, appears and Peter leaves. The narrative switches to him.
Peter goes to Regent's Park, where Septimus and Lucretia Smith, who are already familiar to the reader, are walking. Peter thinks about the past again: especially about how much he loved Clarissa. He also thinks about her snobbish behavior. The Smiths have a heated argument about suicide, which Peter, as an outside observer, thinks is just an argument between young lovers. He does not realize the depth of their feelings and does not notice how insecure Septimus feels. Lucretia makes an appointment with her husband to see the psychiatrist Sir William Bradshaw. This doctor does not take the illness seriously and merely advises Septimus to rest.
Meanwhile, Richard is dining at Lady Bruton's, where Clarissa's friend Hugh Whitbread is also present. Clarissa is not invited to dinner, so her mood is dampened. During the meal, Richard considers going home and confessing to his wife how much he loves her, but ultimately hesitates to make the confession.
Their daughter Elizabeth is studying with her tutor, Miss Kilman, and they have tea together. It turns out that Mrs. Dalloway and Miss Kilman look down on each other and can't stand each other. Elizabeth takes the bus home from Miss Kilman's, but on the way she goes for a walk and enjoys her freedom.
Septimus and Lucretia go home and await the arrival of Dr. Holmes, the veteran's former family doctor. Septimus does not want to be under the doctor's control and refuses to live like this, so he commits suicide by jumping out of the window.
In the last part of the novel, an evening reception at the Dalloways begins. Many characters from Clarissa's past appear, including her two friends: Peter and Sally. In addition, the psychiatrist William Bradshaw and his wife arrive and begin a conversation about Septimus' death. Clarissa is disappointed by the evening.
