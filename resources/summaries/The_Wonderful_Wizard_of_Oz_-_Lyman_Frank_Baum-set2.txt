Summary
Dorothy Gale, a young girl from the state of Kansas, lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and dog Toto on a remote farm in the vast prairie landscape. They are unexpectedly caught up in a tornado that carries them and their house to the fantastical land of Oz, where the house falls on the Wicked Witch of the East and kills her. This witch was the tyrant over the Munchkins, the dwarf people of the land. In return, the Good Witch of the North gives Dorothy a pair of magical silver shoes that belonged to the witch she killed. She explains to Dorothy that the only way home is the Yellow Brick Road, which leads to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz lives. The Good Witch kisses Dorothy goodbye on the forehead, giving her magical protection on her journey.
As Dorothy follows the Yellow Brick Road, she is invited to a feast by a munchkin called Boq. Along the way, she meets three strange companions: a Scarecrow who wants brains, a Tin Woodman who desires a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who lacks courage. She encourages them to accompany her to Emerald City to get help from the Wizard.
After a series of adventures, the companions reach the Emerald City. There, the group meets the Guardian of the Gates, who instructs them to wear green tinted spectacles so that they are not blinded by the city. When they visit the wizard, he appears to them in different forms: Dorothy sees a giant head, the Scarecrow sees a beautiful woman, the Tin Woodman sees a terrifying monster and the Lion sees a ball of fire. Although the wizard tries to scare them, he fails and agrees to help them. However, to do so they must defeat the Wicked Witch of the West, a task which, as the guard warns, no one has ever succeeded in doing.
The Wicked Witch of the West takes a look at the approaching travelers through her magical telescope. She sends wolves to tear the companions apart, but the Tin Woodman destroys them with his axe. Fiercely determined, she sends crows to gouge out their eyes, but the Scarecrow cleverly kills them by twisting their necks. A swarm of black bees is summoned to sting the companions, but their stingers are ineffective against the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow uses its straw to protect the others. Her Winkie slaves try in vain to attack the companions as the lion bravely fends them off. Desperate, the witch calls the Winged Monkeys with their Golden Cap, who capture Dorothy, Toto and the Lion. The Lion is imprisoned, the Scarecrow is scattered and the Tin Woodman is dented, while Dorothy becomes the witch's slave. The witch, eager for the power of Dorothy's silver shoes, takes one shoe from her.
Dorothy then throws a bucket of water on the witch and is horrified when she melts. The Winkies, delighted at their liberation from the witch, help to restore the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and ask the Tin Woodman to become their leader. After he agrees to take Dorothy back to her home, she finds the witch's Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to take the group back to the Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys explains that he and his people are bound to the Golden Cap by a spell cast by the sorceress Gayelette from the North, and that Dorothy can summon them twice more.
On returning to the wizard, Toto discovers the real wizard - an old man who admits to being an impostor - by tipping over a screen in a corner of the throne room. He came to Oz from Omaha in a hot air balloon and has no real magical power. Nevertheless, he gives the Scarecrow a brain made of bran, pins and needles, the Tin Woodman a heart made of sawdust and the Lion a courage potion. They all believe in the power of these symbols and so they fulfill their wishes. The Wizard plans to take Dorothy and Toto home and then return to Omaha. He appoints the Scarecrow as his successor and climbs into his balloon. Toto chases a kitten, and while Dorothy follows him, the balloon's ropes come undone and the Wizard floats away.
Dorothy calls the Winged Monkeys, who explain that they cannot cross the desert that surrounds Oz. Soldier with the Green Whiskers advises her to seek out Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. On the way to Glinda's castle, the Lion defeats a giant spider and the forest animals ask him to become their king. He agrees after helping Dorothy. Dorothy summons the monkeys for the third time and they fly her over a hill to Glinda's castle.
Glinda reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes have the power to take her anywhere. She says goodbye to her friends, who return to their new kingdoms. The Golden Cap is given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, setting him and his gang free. Dorothy taps her heels three times and wishes to go home. She finds herself on the grasses of Kansas, and the silver shoes fall off on the way and are lost. She rushes to Aunt Em's and is overjoyed to be home.
