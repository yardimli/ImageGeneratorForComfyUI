The House of the Seven Gables
Nathaniel Hawthorne
"The House of the Seven Gables" by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic American romance that delves into the themes of inherited guilt, the oppressive weight of the past, and the redemptive power of love. Set in a decaying seven-gabled mansion in a New England town, the novel chronicles the lives of the Pyncheon family, who have been haunted for over 160 years by a curse laid upon them by Matthew Maule, a man unjustly convicted of witchcraft by their ancestor, Colonel Pyncheon. The story explores how the original sin of greed and pride continues to plague generations of Pyncheons, trapping them in misfortune and gloom. The long-standing curse is finally challenged when the young and cheerful Phoebe Pyncheon falls in love with Holgrave, a mysterious photographer who is the last descendant of the Maule family.

Summary
In the year 1850, the House of the Seven Gables has been the Pyncheon family's ancestral home for 160 years. The rusty wooden mansion stands on Pyncheon Street in an unnamed New England town, overshadowed by an enormous elm tree. In the late 1600s, the proud Puritan founder of the family, Colonel Pyncheon, coveted the land on which Matthew Maule's cottage stood. He arranged for Maule to be unjustly convicted of witchcraft, seized his property, and built his mansion upon it. From the gallows, Maule cursed the colonel, declaring, "God will give him blood to drink!"
Matthew's son, Thomas Maule, was hired to build the mansion. Upon its completion, Colonel Pyncheon was found dead in his study with blood on his beard, an event seen by many as the fulfillment of Maule's curse. Generations of Pyncheons have since lived under the shadow of this curse, questioning their right to the property and plagued by misfortune. A claim to valuable Indian lands in Maine remains unsettled because the deed disappeared after the colonel's death. Decades later, another Pyncheon, a wealthy bachelor, was apparently murdered by his nephew, Clifford Pyncheon. It is later revealed, however, that the uncle, Jaffrey Pyncheon, died of natural causes and Clifford was framed by a greedy heir, the man who would become Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon.
As the novel opens, Clifford is about to be paroled after serving 30 years in prison. The Judge, now a powerful political figure, has arranged the parole, believing Clifford knows the location of the missing deed. The house is currently inhabited by the Judge's 60-year-old spinster cousin, Hepzibah Pyncheon. Impoverished, she has swallowed her aristocratic pride to reopen the small cent shop once operated in the house, and to earn more income, rents a room to a 21-year-old daguerreotypist named Holgrave. Refusing the Judge's self-serving "generosity," Hepzibah is determined to provide for her broken brother. Her first customer is Holgrave, and her second is a young boy, Ned Higgins, from whom she reluctantly takes a penny for a gingerbread cookie. Hepzibah is a good woman, but hardship has left a permanent scowl on her face. Humiliated when the smiling Judge passes her shop window, she retreats to scowl at the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, whom the Judge strongly resembles. While a family friend, the philosophical Uncle Venner, advises her to be more cheerful for business, Hepzibah is surprised by the arrival of her beautiful 17-year-old cousin from the country, Phoebe Pyncheon, who has come to live with her.

The next morning, the practical and cheerful Phoebe, a ray of sunshine in the gloomy house, takes charge of the shop. In the garden, she meets Holgrave, who is curious about the greed and pride that have cursed the Pyncheons. He shows her a photograph of Judge Jaffrey, noting his resemblance to the colonel's portrait, and warns her that the water in Maule's Well is "bewitched." That night, Phoebe is kept awake by footsteps on the stairs. The next morning, as she helps an agitated Hepzibah with breakfast, the footsteps are heard again, and Clifford Pyncheon enters the room. A weary, gray-haired man, Clifford is immediately more at ease with the lighthearted Phoebe than with his scowling sister. He asks Hepzibah to cover the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, which horrifies him.
Soon after, the hypocritical Judge Jaffrey arrives. Recognizing Phoebe as his cousin's daughter, he tries to kiss her, but she instinctively pulls back, perhaps reminded of the colonel's portrait. The judge demands to see Clifford, but Hepzibah refuses, feeling her sensitive brother needs protection. The Judge offers to have them live at his country estate, an offer Hepzibah firmly rejects. As Clifford and Phoebe grow closer, they spend hours in the garden. Clifford longs to escape the past and his fear of Judge Jaffrey, often staring into Maule’s well and crying out, “The dark face gazes at me!” One Sunday, Clifford and Hepzibah resolve to follow Phoebe to church, but Clifford stops them, declaring that they are "ghosts" with "no place among human beings."

Influenced by her gloomy surroundings, Phoebe's cheerfulness gives way to "moods of thought," her eyes growing "larger, darker, and deeper." She meets almost daily with Holgrave, a calm, intelligent young man with progressive ideas about the "united struggle of mankind" and a history as a schoolmaster, salesman, editor, traveler, and mesmerist. He confides in her, arguing that the "moss-grown and rotten past is to be torn away." He then reads Phoebe a story he has written about Gervayse Pyncheon, the colonel’s grandson. Anxious to find the missing deed, Gervayse summoned Matthew Maule, the carpenter son of the man who built the house. Matthew agreed to reveal the deed's location if Gervayse would surrender the House and land. The information could only be obtained by hypnotizing Gervayse's daughter, Alice. Driven by greed, Gervayse sacrificed Alice to the carpenter, who made her his hypnotic "slave." Later, he summoned the entranced Alice to his own wedding, and she died the next day from a cold caught in the storm.
As Holgrave finishes the story, Phoebe is in a similar trance-like state, but he refrains from hypnotizing her. Mutually attracted in the moonlit garden, they acknowledge their feelings. Phoebe, committed to helping her cousins, decides to stay, but must first return to the country to settle her affairs.

Several days later, Judge Jaffrey returns, once again demanding to see Clifford. He reveals that 30 years earlier, after his uncle's death, he was unable to find the deed to the eastern lands and believes Clifford knows its whereabouts. He threatens to have Clifford committed to an insane asylum if he refuses to cooperate. Terrified, Hepzibah rushes off to find her brother. Meanwhile, the judge sits down in the ancestral chair beneath the colonel's portrait. When Hepzibah returns from Clifford's empty room, she finds her brother laughing and pointing at the rigid figure of Judge Jaffrey, who has died in the chair. Overjoyed, Clifford shouts, “The weight is gone!” and urges Hepzibah to flee with him. They rush from the house and board a train, where Clifford chatters excitedly to another passenger about the dead weight of the past. Before long, his energy fades, and they get off at the next station, lost and weary.

The deceased Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon remains seated in the ancestral chair, a red stain on his shirt from the blood he choked on. The next morning, the house seems brighter, and Alice Pyncheon's posies are in full bloom. Neighbors knock at the unanswered shop door, whispering that the Judge entered the day before and may have been murdered. Phoebe returns from the country and is greeted by Holgrave, who prepares her for the news by showing her a photograph he took of the dead man. He worries the sudden flight of her relatives will cast suspicion on them. He reveals that the Judge died of the same hereditary illness as the Colonel and the uncle whom Clifford was accused of killing. Holgrave confesses his love for Phoebe, which she returns. At that moment, Hepzibah and Clifford reappear, having returned to face reality.
A few days later, the Judge’s death is ruled a natural one, and Clifford is exonerated. It is revealed that 30 years prior, the bachelor uncle died of shock after catching young Jaffrey searching his papers. Jaffrey had found two wills—one favoring himself, the other Clifford—and destroyed the second, framed Clifford for murder, and inherited the estate. Since the judge’s only son has recently died, Clifford and Hepzibah inherit his wealth. They plan to move to his country estate with Phoebe and Holgrave, who intend to marry, and invite Uncle Venner to join them. Holgrave, showing a newfound conservatism, wishes the estate were built of stone for permanence. He then reveals a secret spring on the Colonel's portrait, which Thomas Maule had installed. The portrait swings away, revealing a hidden recess containing the old Indian deed, now a legally worthless document. When Phoebe asks how he knew the secret, Holgrave confesses that he is a descendant of the wizard, Matthew Maule, and that her love has finally redeemed the Pyncheon evil. A carriage arrives, and the five of them ride away, leaving the House of the Seven Gables behind forever.
