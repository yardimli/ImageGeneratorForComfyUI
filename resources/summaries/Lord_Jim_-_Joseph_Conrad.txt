Lord Jim
Joseph Conrad

"Lord Jim" by Joseph Conrad is a psychological novel that explores themes of honor, cowardice, and redemption. It follows the story of Jim, a young British sailor in the merchant marine, whose single act of cowardice aboard the ship Patna casts a shadow over his entire life. Haunted by his past, Jim seeks to escape his reputation by moving ever eastward through the ports of the British Empire, until he finds a chance to reinvent himself in the remote land of Patusan. The novel, largely narrated by the thoughtful sea captain Marlow, examines the conflict between romantic idealism and the harsh realities of life, and questions whether true honor can ever be regained.

Summary
Jim is a capable and likable young man working as a water-clerk in various Far Eastern seaports. He is haunted by a cowardly act from his past which has barred him from working as a sailor and caused him to conceal his last name. Wherever he goes, his identity as the coward from the Patna ship disaster eventually becomes known, forcing him to move on to another port, ever farther east. As a teenager, Jim was inspired by adventure novels and imagined himself a hero. During his officer training, however, he failed to respond properly during a crisis, though he rationalized his inaction by believing he was destined for greater perils.

Two years later, after finding sea life boring, Jim was promoted to chief mate. An injury led to his hospitalization in Singapore, and upon his discharge, he became first mate on the Patna, an old steamer carrying 800 Moslem pilgrims to the Holy Land. One night, the ship struck a submerged object, an event that would define the rest of Jim's life. A month later, an official inquiry was held to determine what happened. Jim was the only crew member to face the court, as the German captain had vanished and the engineers were hospitalized. During his testimony, Jim noticed a sympathetic white man in the crowd, a British sea captain named Marlow.

Years later, Marlow recounts the story to guests at a dinner party. The tale of the Patna, deserted by its crew and towed to port by a French gunboat, had become a waterside legend. Marlow first saw Jim when he arrived with the Patna's captain and engineers. The captain was stripped of his certificate and disappeared, leaving Jim to face the consequences. Though Marlow initially disliked the youth, he came to see him as a trustworthy and honorable man. The chief engineer, suffering from delirium tremens, was hospitalized and unable to attend the inquiry.

Marlow admired Jim’s courage for facing the court when he could have fled. The presiding officer, Captain Montague Brierly, found the affair disgraceful and even offered Marlow money to help Jim escape, an offer Marlow refused. A week later, Brierly committed suicide, leading Marlow to surmise that Jim’s struggle with honor had forced Brierly to confront the "sham" of his own perfect life. After a misunderstanding, Marlow invited Jim to dinner, where Jim confessed the full story of the Patna. After the ship was struck, Jim discovered it was taking on water and would soon sink. Knowing there were not enough lifeboats for the 800 pilgrims, he was horrified when the captain and two crewmen tried to lower a boat for themselves. After a scuffle, the men were in the lifeboat and called for the third engineer, George, to join them, but he had died of a heart attack. In a moment of panic, hearing them call for "George," Jim jumped, abandoning the ship and his heroic ideals. Hours later, their lifeboat was rescued, and Jim learned that the Patna and its passengers had been saved by a French gunboat.

The inquiry ended with the revocation of Jim's seaman's certificate. Feeling responsible, Marlow tried to help him find work. He refused an exploitative offer from an entrepreneur named Chester, a job that would have led to Jim's death in a storm. Marlow then sent Jim to work at a friend's rice mill, but Jim left abruptly when the Patna's second engineer arrived. He took another job as a water-clerk but fled again when his past was about to be exposed. Worried, Marlow consulted his friend Stein, a wealthy and respected merchant. Stein saw Jim as a romantic idealist and believed the only way for him to live was to fully commit to his dream. As a favor, Stein offered Jim a position managing one of his trading posts in Patusan, a remote province in Sumatra, replacing a devious man named Cornelius.

Two years later, Marlow visited Patusan and found Jim happy and transformed. Jim recounted his arrival: he was taken prisoner by the local rajah, Tunku Allang, but escaped after three days and reached Doramin, the rajah's chief rival. With the help of Doramin, his son Dain Waris, and a loyal servant named Tamb' Itam, Jim defeated a local bandit, Sherif Ali. This victory made him a legendary figure, and he became known as "Tuan Jim," or Lord Jim, his word becoming law. He had also fallen in love with Jewel, the stepdaughter of Cornelius. After he defeated assassins sent to kill him, their bond deepened, but Jim was still haunted by the Patna. When Marlow departed, he saw Jim as happy, but wondered if it was genuine. It was the last time he saw him alive.

Two years after his visit, Marlow writes a letter detailing Jim's tragic death. A pirate named Gentleman Brown and his crew had raided Patusan for supplies while Jim was away. Dain Waris and Jewel organized a defense that trapped the pirates. Doramin, to protect his son, had sent him to guard a river entrance miles away. Meanwhile, the rajah's representative, Kassim, and the resentful Cornelius plotted with Brown to overthrow Jim. When Jim returned, he came face-to-face with Brown. Seeing a reflection of his own haunted past in the pirate, Jim identified with Brown's plight and persuaded the people of Patusan to let the pirates go free.

Jim sent Tamb' Itam with Doramin's ring to instruct Dain Waris to let Brown's ship pass. However, the evil Cornelius betrayed their plan to Brown, telling him where Dain Waris's men were positioned. In an act of revenge, the pirates ambushed and killed the unsuspecting men, including Dain Waris. Tamb' Itam witnessed the slaughter and killed Cornelius before rushing back to warn Jim. Jewel and Tamb' Itam urged Jim to defend himself, but he chose to face Doramin and accept responsibility for the murders. Overcome with grief for his son, Doramin shot and killed Jim. In dying for another man's crime, Jim believed he had finally redeemed his lost honor, even as he abandoned his lover and the people who had come to depend on him.
