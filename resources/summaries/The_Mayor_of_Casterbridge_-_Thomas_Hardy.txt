The Mayor of Casterbridge
Thomas Hardy
"The Mayor of Casterbridge" by Thomas Hardy is a tragic novel that tells the story of Michael Henchard, a man whose character is his fate. The novel charts the rise of a poor farm worker to a position of wealth and power after impulsively selling his wife and daughter in a drunken fit, only to have his past crime and his own reckless personality return to engineer his downfall. It is a powerful exploration of how an individual's character and rash decisions determine the fate imposed by a cold, indifferent universe, and how justice, in its own time, punishes those who transgress against the moral order.
Summary
The year is 1830 and Michael Henchard, a 21-year-old unemployed hay-trusser, walks along a dusty country road in upper Wessex with his wife, Susan, and their infant daughter, Elizabeth-Jane. They approach the village of Weydon-Priors, where a fair is in progress, and find seats in a tent selling furmity. After an old woman adds rum to his broth, a drunk Henchard boisterously announces he will “sell” his wife and daughter to the highest bidder, blaming his family for his hardships. What begins as a joke becomes serious when a young sailor, Richard Newson, makes a cash offer that Henchard accepts. The stunned crowd watches as the sailor leads Susan and Elizabeth-Jane away, but not before Susan tearfully throws her wedding ring in Henchard’s face. Henchard passes out and awakens the next morning full of regret. After vowing not to drink for 21 years, he sets out to find his family, only to learn they have emigrated to Canada with Newson. Henchard ends his search and sets out for the town of Casterbridge to start a new life.

Nineteen years later, Susan, now known as Mrs. Newson, returns to the fairground with her daughter, Elizabeth-Jane. Richard Newson has recently been reported lost at sea, and Susan, with no means of support, searches for Henchard. Elizabeth-Jane knows only that he is a “distant relative.” Learning from the old furmity woman that Henchard moved to Casterbridge, they set out for the town. Upon arrival, they discover the 40-year-old Henchard has become a rich grain merchant and the powerful Mayor of Casterbridge. They find him at the King’s Arms Hotel being accused by tradesmen of distributing bad corn. Henchard replies that he has solved the problem by advertising for a manager. A handsome Scottish stranger, Donald Farfrae, sends Henchard a note that interests him greatly. Later, at their inn, Susan and Elizabeth-Jane overhear Farfrae telling Henchard how to make the poor wheat wholesome. Henchard offers the Scotsman a job, but Farfrae plans to emigrate to America. Later that night, Elizabeth-Jane finds herself attracted to Farfrae as he sings in the crowded inn. The next morning, she delivers a letter from her mother to Henchard and discovers Farfrae has changed his mind and is now Henchard's foreman. She introduces herself, and a shocked Henchard realizes his wife is in town. He arranges a meeting with Susan at the Ring, the ruins of a Roman amphitheater, that night.

At their meeting, Henchard, wanting to protect his reputation, proposes a plan: he will secretly establish Susan in town, then innocently court and “remarry” her. She accepts. He impulsively confesses the whole story to Farfrae, explaining he must now break his engagement to another young woman. Henchard’s plan goes smoothly, and within months he “marries” Susan. Farfrae begins courting Elizabeth-Jane, and Henchard's business prospers under the Scotsman’s supervision. However, tension grows when the hot-tempered Henchard argues with Farfrae over the severe punishment of a worker. The rivalry explodes when they plan separate festivities for a national holiday; bad weather ruins Henchard’s event while Farfrae’s attracts a large crowd, leading a jealous Henchard to fire the young Scotsman.
Farfrae starts a competing grain business, and Henchard retaliates by forbidding him to see Elizabeth-Jane. Susan falls gravely ill and gives Henchard a sealed letter to be opened only after Elizabeth-Jane’s wedding, then quietly dies. Soon after, Henchard tells Elizabeth-Jane he is her real father, but moments later he impulsively opens Susan’s letter and discovers a devastating truth: his own daughter died three months after the sale, and this Elizabeth-Jane is in fact Newson’s child. Crushed, Henchard decides not to tell Elizabeth-Jane, but his secret anger causes him to grow cold and aloof with her. She is eventually forced to move out and accept a job as a live-in companion to a wealthy young woman new to town.

Elizabeth-Jane moves in with Lucetta Le Sueur, who is revealed to be the woman with whom Henchard had the affair. Having inherited money, she changed her name to Lucetta Templeman and moved to Casterbridge to renew her relationship with the now-widowed mayor. However, she soon falls in love with Farfrae and rebuffs Henchard, further enraging him. Henchard's influence dwindles when he loses the mayoral election, and he decides to ruin Farfrae by speculating heavily that bad weather will destroy the harvest. The weather remains good, and Henchard goes bankrupt while Farfrae makes a fortune. A desperate Henchard blackmails Lucetta into agreeing to marry him by threatening to expose their past affair. Soon after, Henchard presides as a judge at the trial of the old furmity woman, who publicly reveals his crime from 20 years earlier. Afraid to marry such a man, Lucetta elopes with Farfrae. Elizabeth-Jane is crushed and moves into a small apartment.

The bankrupt and disgraced Henchard moves to modest quarters, and Farfrae takes over his business. Henchard is forced to take a job as a common laborer for Farfrae, whom he curses. When his 21-year oath of abstinence ends, he begins drinking heavily. Farfrae’s victory is complete when he is elected mayor. Henchard threatens to reveal Lucetta’s love letters to Farfrae, but ultimately cannot bring himself to ruin her marriage. He agrees to return the letters, but sends them with Joshua Jopp, a shady character with a grudge against Lucetta. Jopp reads the letters in a pub, and the patrons decide to stage a “skimmington ride”—a crude, mocking parade with effigies of Henchard and Lucetta to ridicule their affair. Meanwhile, a drunken Henchard interrupts a royal ceremony and is forcibly removed by Mayor Farfrae. Furious, Henchard lures Farfrae to a high loft and they fight. Henchard overpowers his enemy but cannot bring himself to kill him. Later that night, Lucetta sees the vulgar ceremony. Horrified, she faints, miscarries, and dies.

The shock of Lucetta’s death brings Henchard and Elizabeth-Jane together again. Believing only his “daughter’s” love can make him happy, his hopes are shattered when Newson arrives, explaining he had faked his death to free Susan from their forced relationship. Henchard lies, telling Newson that Elizabeth-Jane is dead. Fearing the truth will be discovered, Henchard goes to a river to drown himself but changes his mind when he sees his own effigy from the skimmington ride floating in the water. In the following months, Farfrae begins courting Elizabeth-Jane. Henchard’s fears come true when Newson returns. In shame, Henchard leaves town before he can be exposed. When Elizabeth-Jane finally meets Newson and learns the truth, she vows never to speak to Henchard again.
Henchard becomes a wandering laborer. Upon learning that Elizabeth-Jane and Farfrae are to be wed, he buys a caged goldfinch as a gift and travels to their wedding reception. He is coldly rejected by Elizabeth-Jane, who refuses to forgive his deceit. A remorseful Henchard flees into the darkness. A month later, Elizabeth-Jane finds the birdcage with the dead goldfinch inside. Realizing it was Henchard’s gift and regretting her coldness, she and Farfrae set out to find him. They are told by a humble peasant, Abel Whittle, that Henchard died just half an hour before they arrived. Abel had cared for him after he fell ill following the wedding. Following his will, Elizabeth-Jane has him buried humbly and anonymously. She then settles into married life with Farfrae, strengthened by the hard-earned knowledge that “happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.”
