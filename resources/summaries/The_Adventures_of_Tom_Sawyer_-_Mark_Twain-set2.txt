Summary
Tom Sawyer, an orphan boy, lives with his aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid in St. Petersburg, Missouri in the 1840s. A notorious truant with a taste for adventure, Tom is caught coming home late one Friday night after getting into a fight. As punishment, Aunt Polly obliges him to paint her fence the following day.
Tom cleverly uses the situation to his advantage and convinces the children in the neighborhood not only to help him with the work, but also to pay him with trinkets and valuables. He presents the work as a pleasure that they should not miss out on. He later exchanges the treasures he collects for raffle tickets at Sunday school, which are given away for memorizing Bible verses. Despite his ignorance of religious matters, he collects so many tickets that he receives a valuable Bible as a prize. This causes envy among the children and surprise and admiration among the adults.
During this time, Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, the daughter of an influential judge and a newcomer to the town. He wins the judge's sympathy when he accepts the Bible as a prize at church, but quickly reveals his ignorance when he is unable to answer basic questions about the Holy Scripture. Nevertheless, Tom manages to win Becky's heart and they become engaged with a kiss. However, their love soon suffers a setback when Becky learns that Tom was previously engaged to another student, Amy Lawrence.
Shortly after Tom is rejected by Becky, he accompanies Huckleberry (Huck) Finn, a tramp admired by all the other boys, to the graveyard at midnight to perform a superstitious ritual to cure warts. In the graveyard, they witness three robbers, Dr. S. Robinson, Muff Potter and Injun Joe, digging up a grave. A fight ensues in which Potter is knocked unconscious by Robinson and later killed by Injun Joe. When Potter regains consciousness, Injun Joe puts a gun in his hand and says that he killed Robinson while drunk. Tom and Huck swear by blood not to tell anyone about the murder for fear that Injun Joe might find out and kill them in revenge. Potter is arrested and sent to prison, where he has to wait for his trial without contesting Injun Joe's accusations.
Tom feels bored and underchallenged at school. Together with his friend and classmate Joe Harper and Huck, he decides to flee to Jackson's Island in the Mississippi to lead an exciting life as "pirates". While the boys enjoy their newfound freedom, they realize that the village community thinks they are dead and searches the river for their bodies.
One night, Tom sneaks home to witness the excitement. After a brief pang of remorse over his family's suffering, he comes up with an impressive idea: they could show up at their own funeral. The three of them put the plan into action and surprise everyone by suddenly appearing in the church during the funeral service. Their sensational performance earns them the respect and admiration of their classmates.
Back at school, Tom frightens Becky so that she tears a page out of the principal's anatomy book. However, Tom manages to regain her affection by taking the blame and the punishment that should have been inflicted on her.
During Potter's murder trial, Tom breaks his oath to Huck and testifies in his defense, calling Injun Joe the real culprit. Injun Joe escapes from the courtroom but is caught. Potter is acquitted, yet Tom and Huck now constantly live in fear for their lives.
During their summer vacation, Tom and Huck decide to search for buried treasure in the area. As they investigate an abandoned house, they secretly observe two men. One of them is a Spaniard, supposedly deaf and dumb, who the boys recognize as Injun Joe in disguise. He and his partner plan to bury a stolen treasure in the house, but accidentally discover a large hoard of gold coins.
They decide to take him to a new hideout, which Tom and Huck are determined to find. One night, Huck follows the men and overhears them planning to break into the house of the wealthy Widow Douglas so that Injun Joe can mutilate her face in revenge for being publicly flogged for vagrancy - a punishment imposed by her late husband, a justice of the peace. Huck calls for help and prevents the break-in, but asks that his name not be revealed for fear of retaliation from Injun Joe.
Just before Huck stops the crime, Tom has a picnic with Becky and her classmates in a local cave. Tom and Becky get lost and wander around the cave for several days, where they are in danger of starving and dehydrating. Becky suffers from severe dehydration and physical weakness, while Tom desperately searches for a way out. He encounters Injun Joe by chance, but goes unnoticed. Eventually he finds a way out, and he and Becky are greeted joyfully in town when they learn that they have been missing for three days. Judge Thatcher then has the front door of the cave reinforced and locked. When Tom learns of this action two weeks later, he is horrified because he knows that Injun Joe is still in the cave. He sends a search party to the cave, where they find Injun Joe starved to death at the entrance.
A week later, having deduced from Injun Joe's presence that the stolen gold must be hidden in the cave, Tom takes Huck with him on the search. They find the gold, which amounts to over 12,000 dollars and is invested in their name. Huck is adopted by the widow Douglas, but he finds the regular life in a civilized family unbearable. He thinks back longingly to his early, unattached life as a tramp and feels the urge to take it up again. However, he reluctantly returns to the widow, as Tom has persuaded him to form a first-class band of robbers.
