Doctor Faustus
Christopher Marlowe

Christopher Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus" is a seminal work of Elizabethan tragedy, telling the story of a brilliant but arrogant German scholar who sells his soul to the devil. Bored with the limitations of conventional knowledge, Doctor John Faustus makes a pact for 24 years of unlimited power and wisdom, served by the demon Mephistophiles. The play charts his journey from ambitious intellectual to a man consumed by trivial pleasures, exploring profound themes of pride, sin, damnation, and the struggle for repentance.
Summary
At the University of Wittenberg, the brilliant scholar Doctor John Faustus has mastered logic, medicine, law, and even divinity, yet finds them all unsatisfying. Believing that humans are destined to sin and be punished, he rejects traditional studies and turns to the forbidden art of black magic, convinced it will grant him omnipotence. Despite a warning from a Good Angel, Faustus, encouraged by an Evil Angel, seeks help from the magicians Valdes and Cornelius to learn how to conjure spirits.
Faustus successfully summons Mephistophiles, a devil from hell. Eager for power, Faustus offers to sell his soul to Lucifer in exchange for 24 years of Mephistophiles's service and absolute power on Earth. Mephistophiles agrees to take the offer to his master. While he waits, Faustus's servant, Wagner, mimics his master by using a book of magic to frighten a local Clown into his service.
Mephistophiles returns with Lucifer's terms: Faustus must sign a contract written in his own blood. As Faustus cuts his arm, the blood congeals, a divine warning he ignores. After Mephistophiles warms the blood with hot coals, Faustus signs away his soul. An inscription, "Homo, fuge!" (Flee, man!), appears on his arm, but Mephistophiles distracts him with a display of riches. Faustus, now believing hell is a fable, asks for a wife, but as marriage is a holy sacrament, Mephistophiles instead provides him with a book of magic and promises him any lover he desires.
Soon, Faustus is seized by remorse and curses Mephistophiles for denying him heaven. He nearly repents, but his heart is hardened. When he angers Mephistophiles by asking who made the world—a question the demon cannot answer—Faustus calls on Christ for salvation. Instead, Lucifer himself appears, admonishes Faustus to honor their pact, and entertains him with a parade of the Seven Deadly Sins to show him the "delight" of hell. Won over, Faustus abandons repentance.
Faustus and Mephistophiles embark on a tour of Europe. Their great powers are used for petty tricks and amusements. In Rome, they become invisible to torment the Pope, stealing his food and striking him during a feast. Back in Germany, two commoners, Robin and Ralph, find one of Faustus's books and accidentally summon an infuriated Mephistophiles, who punishes them by turning one into an ape and the other into a dog. Faustus's fame reaches the court of Emperor Charles V, for whom he conjures spirits resembling Alexander the Great and his lover. When a knight scoffs, Faustus causes horns to sprout from his head. Later, he sells a horse-trader a magical horse that dissolves in water and conjures a dish of fresh grapes for the Duchess of Vanholt.
As his 24 years draw to a close, Faustus returns to Wittenberg. He conjures a spirit in the form of Helen of Troy for his fellow scholars. An old man appears and makes a final, passionate plea for Faustus to repent and seek God's mercy. Consumed with guilt, Faustus is on the verge of suicide when the old man again urges him to have hope. However, Mephistophiles threatens to tear him to pieces if he breaks his vow. Terrified, Faustus reaffirms his pledge to Lucifer and asks for one final pleasure: to embrace Helen of Troy. Mephistophiles summons her, and Faustus, awestruck, kisses her, hoping her beauty will make him immortal. The kiss is a demonic trap, as Helen is a succubus who attempts to suck out his soul.
In his final hour, Faustus bids a despairing farewell to his colleagues, lamenting that he has traded "eternal joy and felicity" for "vain pleasure of twenty-four years." He tries to pray for mercy but feels his sins are too great to be pardoned. As the clock strikes midnight, he wishes he could cease to exist to escape eternal damnation. The earth opens, and demons drag the screaming Faustus down to hell.
