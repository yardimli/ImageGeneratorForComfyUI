The Sorrows of Young Werther
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe


"The Sorrows of Young Werther" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is one of the key works of German literature and marked the height of the "Sturm und Drang", a literary movement that emphasized deep emotions and a return to nature. The novel, written in the form of letters, tells the story of Werther, a young, artistically gifted man of intense sensitivity whose unrequited love for Charlotte leads to his increasing despair and eventual suicide.
Summary
The story spans from May 4, 1771 to December 24, 1772. Werther, a young man in his twenties, from a good home and educated, with a particular passion for drawing and classical works, leaves his hometown to settle an inheritance matter for his mother and at the same time leave an unhappy love behind him. He first takes up residence in a town and then moves to the neighboring, picturesque village of "Wahlheim" (Garbenheim). There he enjoys walks in the countryside and records his impressions in small drawings.
One day he meets the friendly bailiff S., a widower with nine children, who invites Werther to his home. Werther postpones the visit and soon forgets about it. On the way to an evening dance, the carriage in which Werther is traveling stops at the bailiff's house to give his daughter Charlotte a lift. Werther is immediately impressed when he sees Charlotte preparing dinner for her eight younger siblings and taking on the role of mother. During the ball, Werther asks Charlotte for the second counter-dance, but she agrees to the third. During the dance, Charlotte's friends notice the obvious attraction between Lotte and Werther and mention a certain Albert. Charlotte explains to Werther that Albert is "a good man" and that they are practically engaged. Later that evening, a thunderstorm rolls in. Werther and Charlotte observe the refreshed nature after the rain from a window. The same ode, "Die Frühlingsfeier" by Klopstock, comes to both of their minds. Werther sees this as a sign of their affinity and from then on repeatedly seeks Charlotte's company.
When Charlotte's fiancé Albert returns from a business trip, Werther's mood begins to change. A love triangle develops, in which Charlotte initially seems like a "saint" to Werther, with whom he feels no desire. At the beginning, the relationship between Werther and Charlotte is therefore purely platonic. Albert and Werther become friends and have in-depth conversations, including about suicide and melancholy, the "disease of death". This reveals the two men's contrasting characters: Werther is filled with strong emotions, while Albert appears as a level-headed traditionalist. However, when Werther realizes that he has to hold back his intense feelings for Charlotte because of Albert, he leaves the town in a hurry without saying goodbye. This is triggered by a very emotional conversation in which it becomes clear that Charlotte has promised her dying mother that she will marry Albert.
Werther spends some time with an envoy at court, where the pedantry of his superior and the rigid court etiquette quickly disillusion him. He feels like an outsider and cannot identify with this society. When he is gently removed from an aristocratic gathering by Count C. because many guests feel disturbed by his bourgeois origins and his misstep is publicly whispered about, he is deeply affected. In addition, a new acquaintance who looks like Charlotte gently tries to make it clear to him that he is too cocky and not sufficiently aware of his bourgeois status. Shortly after he learns that Charlotte and Albert have married without informing or inviting him, he asks to be released and leaves the court. He initially stays with a prince who is well disposed towards him, but only stays there for a few weeks, returns to his home town and finally moves back to Wahlheim.
Soon afterwards, Werther begins to visit Charlotte regularly again. Without intending to, Charlotte plays with his feelings, for example by letting her canary peck first at her lips and then at his, which further fuels Werther's passion. When Werther refuses her offer to enjoy the pleasures of true friendship and they are already being talked about in the village, Charlotte feels pressured. At Albert's request, she asks Werther to wait four days and not visit her again until Christmas Eve.
Despite the deadline set by Charlotte, Werther visits her early and during Albert's absence to read to her from his translation of the Ossian poems. Similar to their earlier encounter, they are once again overwhelmed by their emotions. However, when Werther begins to passionately embrace and kiss Charlotte, questioning the platonic nature of their relationship, she withdraws in confusion, flees into the next room and locks herself away. Although Charlotte may secretly reciprocate Werther's interest, she is irrevocably bound to her husband and has no choice but to urge her friend to leave.
In order not to endanger Charlotte's marriage and her honor any further, Werther decides to stop bothering her and take his own life. The next day, on Albert's return, he receives a written request from Werther to lend him his pistols on the grounds that he will soon be traveling; Albert agrees and it is Charlotte herself who hands them over to her friend's servant with a trembling hand. The tormented young man retires to his house after he has finished his business, visited Charlotte's little brothers one last time and taken a final walk through the countryside, where he dismisses his servant and finishes writing his farewell letter to Charlotte. In it, Werther expresses, among other things, the hope of seeing her again in another life. At the stroke of midnight, Werther shoots himself in the forehead with one of the pistols Albert has lent him.
When the servant enters his room the next morning, he finds him bleeding to death; Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's drama "Emilia Galotti" lies open on his desk. A doctor is called, friends and the authorities rush in. After hours of agony, Werther dies around noon. No priest accompanies his funeral procession (as suicides are denied a Christian burial), not even Albert and Charlotte. Instead, her father and younger siblings attend. Eleven hours after his death, Werther is buried by the local craftsmen in a place in the village, between two large lime trees, in accordance with his last wish in his farewell letter.
