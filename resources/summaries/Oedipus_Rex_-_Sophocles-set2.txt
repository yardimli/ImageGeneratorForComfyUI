Oedipus Rex
Sophocles


"Oedipus Rex" by Sophocles is a masterpiece of ancient Greek tragedy and is considered one of the pinnacles of dramatic art. The play embodies the classical elements of tragedy through its complex plot, deep characters and relentless use of irony and dramatic tension. It tells the story of King Oedipus of Thebes, who unwittingly kills his father and marries his mother, and poses central questions about fate, guilt and human knowledge.
Summary
Oedipus, King of Thebes, sends his brother-in-law Creon to the Oracle of Delphi for advice as Thebes is ravaged by a plague. Creon returns and tells them that the plague is due to the fact that the murderer of their former king Laius was never caught. Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him as the cause of the plague.
Oedipus turns to the blind prophet Teiresias for help. Teiresias confesses that he knows the answers, but refuses to reveal them and advises Oedipus to end the search. Angered by the seer's refusal, Oedipus accuses him of being involved in the murder of Laius. The exasperated Teiresias then reveals that Oedipus himself is the wanted criminal. Oedipus cannot believe this and suspects that Creon must have paid Teiresias to discredit him. A fierce argument ensues, during which Oedipus mocks Teiresias' blindness and Teiresias replies that Oedipus is in fact the blind man. Finally, Teiresias leaves the house and gloomily prophesies that the real murderer is a native of Thebes who is both brother and father to his children and son and husband to his own mother.
Creon appears to face Oedipus' accusations. Oedipus demands that Creon be executed, but the chorus persuades him to let Creon live. At this moment, Iocaste, the wife of Laius and later Oedipus, enters and tries to calm Oedipus down. She advises him not to pay any attention to the prophets. As proof, she recounts a prophecy that she and Laius had received and which never came true: Laius was to be killed by his own son, but instead he was murdered by robbers at a fork in the road.
The mention of this place makes Oedipus wonder, and he asks for further details. Iocaste describes the fork in the road that leads to Daulis and Delphi. Reminded of Teiresias' words, Oedipus asks Iocaste to describe Laius' appearance. The king then orders a shepherd, the only surviving witness to the attack, to be brought from his fields to the palace.
Iocaste notices Oedipus' confusion and asks what is going on. He explains the situation to her: many years ago, at a banquet in Corinth, a drunken man had accused Oedipus of not being his father's biological son. Oedipus then went to Delphi to ask the oracle about his true parentage. However, the oracle did not answer him directly, but instead prophesied that he would one day kill his father and marry his mother. Horrified by this prediction, Oedipus decided never to return to Corinth in order to avoid fate.
On his journey, he reached the crossroads where Laius had been murdered. There he encountered a chariot whose occupants wanted to force him off the road. A conflict ensued and Oedipus killed the passengers, including a man who matched the description of Laius given by Iocaste. However, Oedipus hopes that he is not the murderer of Laius, as it has been reported that Laius was killed by several robbers. He waits for the shepherd to confirm that Laius was attacked by several men, because then Oedipus would be exonerated.
A messenger arrives from Corinth and announces that Polybus, who raised Oedipus as his son, has died. Surprisingly, Oedipus is overjoyed at the news, as he can no longer kill his father, which partially disproves the oracle's prophecy. Nevertheless, the fear remains that he could commit incest with his mother. To reassure Oedipus, the messenger assures him that Merope, Polybus' wife, is not his biological mother.
The messenger goes on to explain that many years earlier, a shepherd from the household of Laius had given him an infant to dispose of while he was tending his flock on Mount Kithairon. The messenger gave the child to Polybus instead, who raised it as his own son. Oedipus then turns to the chorus and asks if anyone knows the identity of this other shepherd or where he is.
The chorus informs him that it is the same shepherd who witnessed the murder of Laius and whom Oedipus had already summoned. When Iocaste realizes the truth, she desperately begs Oedipus not to ask any more questions. However, when Oedipus insists on answers, Iocaste flees to the palace.
When the shepherd arrives, Oedipus questions him insistently. However, the shepherd asks to be allowed to leave without giving any further answers. Despite his request, Oedipus puts him under pressure, eventually threatening him with torture or execution. Under this pressure, the shepherd reveals that the child he gave away was Laius' own son. Iocaste gave her son to the shepherd to abandon him on the mountainside, fearing the prophecy that the child would kill his father.
Eventually, the whole truth is revealed and Oedipus curses himself and fate before leaving the stage. The chorus laments how even a great man can be beaten by fate. Shortly afterwards, a servant leaves the palace to report what has happened inside. Iocaste has hanged herself in her bedchamber. Oedipus, full of fear, enters the palace and asks his servants to bring him a sword so that he can kill Iocaste himself. But when he finds the lifeless queen, he takes the long golden pins from her dress instead and, in his despair, stabs out his own eyes.
The blinded King Oedipus leaves the palace and asks to be banished. Creon appears and suggests that Oedipus be brought indoors until the oracles can be consulted to decide what action is most appropriate. Oedipus' two daughters and half-sisters, Antigone and Ismene, are sent out. Oedipus laments the fate of his daughters, who were born into such a cursed family. He appeals to Creon to take care of them and make sure that they have the chance of a better life than he has. Creon agrees and leads Oedipus back to the palace.
On the now empty stage, the chorus repeats a common Greek wisdom: no man should be considered happy before his death.
