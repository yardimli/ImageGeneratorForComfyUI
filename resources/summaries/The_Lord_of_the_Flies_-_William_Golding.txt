The Lord of the Flies
William Golding
William Golding's "The Lord of the Flies" is a stark and resonant novel that explores the dark side of human nature. The story begins when a plane evacuating a group of British schoolboys during a fictional atomic war crashes on a deserted tropical island. Left without adult supervision, the boys attempt to create a civilized society, but their efforts quickly collapse. As the veneer of order crumbles, primal instincts take over, and the boys descend into a state of brutal savagery. The novel serves as a powerful fable about the conflict between civilization and barbarism, questioning the inherent innocence of humanity and suggesting that the "beast" they fear is actually the evil that resides within themselves.
Summary
Following a plane crash on a deserted tropical island, the first two survivors to appear are a fair-haired boy named Ralph and a fat, asthmatic boy known as Piggy. Ralph discovers a conch shell, and when he blows it, the other surviving boys assemble. They elect Ralph as their chief. Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir, is made the head of the hunters. Ralph, Jack, and an intelligent boy named Simon explore the island and confirm it is uninhabited. At a meeting, Ralph establishes rules, chief among them that one must hold the conch to speak. A small boy with a birthmark on his face speaks of a fearsome "snake-thing" in the forest. To reassure everyone and signal for rescue, Ralph proposes building a fire on the mountain. Jack and the others rush off recklessly and light a massive blaze using Piggy’s glasses, but the fire quickly rages out of control, and in the aftermath, the boy with the birthmark is missing.
As weeks pass, a conflict grows between Ralph, who is frustrated that only Simon helps him build shelters, and Jack, who is obsessed with hunting. Simon, meanwhile, often retreats alone to a secluded clearing in the jungle. The darker side of the boys' nature emerges as Roger, one of Jack's followers, throws stones near a younger boy. To aid his hunting, Jack begins painting his face with a mask, which liberates him from his inhibitions. One day, Ralph spots a ship on the horizon, but his hope turns to fury when he discovers that Jack and his hunters have let the signal fire go out while on their first successful pig hunt. When the hunters return, Jack, angered by Piggy's criticism, strikes him, breaking one of the lenses of his glasses.
Ralph calls an assembly to confront the boys' general irresponsibility and their growing fear of a beast. Simon suggests that the beast might actually be a part of themselves, but he is ridiculed. When Jack openly challenges Ralph’s authority, the meeting descends into chaos. That night, a dead parachutist from an aerial battle drifts down and lands on the mountain. The twins Sam and Eric, on fire duty, mistake the corpse's moving form for the beast and flee in terror. Jack leads a hunt for the beast, which ends at an unexplored peninsula called Castle Rock.
While tracking a boar, Ralph experiences the intoxicating thrill of the hunt. Afterwards, the boys reenact the hunt with a boy named Robert playing the pig, their savage chanting and dancing nearly harming him. Taunted by Jack, Ralph continues the search for the beast after dark. He, Jack, and Roger climb the mountain and see the horrifying, ape-like silhouette of the dead parachutist, which they believe to be the beast. Terrified, they flee. Angered by Ralph's leadership, Jack breaks away to form his own tribe. While Simon retreats to his jungle clearing, he witnesses Jack’s tribe brutally kill a sow and mount its head on a sharpened stick as an offering. Simon gazes at the fly-covered head, the "Lord of the Flies," and hallucinates a conversation in which it confirms that the beast is the evil within them all. Simon then faints.
Upon waking, Simon discovers the truth about the dead parachutist on the mountain and sets out to inform the others. At the same time, Ralph and Piggy have gone to Jack's feast, where the boys are swept into a frenzied, ritualistic dance as a storm brews. When Simon stumbles out of the forest to share his discovery, the hysterical boys mistake him for the beast and savagely kill him. Later, Ralph is consumed by guilt, calling it murder, while Piggy tries to dismiss it as an accident. Jack's tribe raids Ralph’s camp in the night, stealing Piggy’s glasses and leaving Ralph's small group powerless.
Ralph, Piggy, and the twins go to Castle Rock to confront Jack and demand the return of the glasses. A fight breaks out between Ralph and Jack. Piggy, holding the conch, attempts to appeal to their sense of reason. High above, Roger deliberately releases a huge boulder, which shatters the conch, kills Piggy, and hurls his body into the sea. Ralph flees as Jack's tribe hurls spears at him, and the twins are captured and forced to join the tribe. The next day, the savages begin a relentless hunt for Ralph, setting the island on fire to smoke him out of his hiding place. The massive blaze drives a terrified Ralph to the beach, where he collapses before a naval officer whose ship was attracted by the smoke. The officer mistakes the boys' war for a game, and when he learns of the deaths, he is shocked. Overwhelmed by the brutal events, Ralph weeps for the end of innocence, the darkness of the human heart, and the death of his friend Piggy.
