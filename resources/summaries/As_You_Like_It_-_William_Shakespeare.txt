As You Like It
William Shakespeare

"As You Like It" by William Shakespeare is one of the playwright's most beloved romantic comedies. The play follows its heroine, Rosalind, as she flees persecution in her uncle's court, accompanied by her cousin Celia, to find safety and love in the Forest of Arden. Famous for its vibrant characters, witty dialogue, and exploration of the different facets of love, the play contrasts the corruption of courtly life with the liberating potential of the natural world.
Summary
The story begins with Orlando de Boys complaining to his servant, Adam, that his older brother, Oliver, has denied him the inheritance and education left to him by their late father. When Oliver appears, a fight ensues, and Oliver secretly plots to have Orlando killed in a wrestling match at the court of Duke Frederick. Meanwhile, at the court, Duke Frederick's daughter, Celia, consoles her cousin Rosalind, whose father, Duke Senior, was banished by Frederick. Orlando wins the wrestling match, impressing Rosalind, who gives him a chain from her neck. Angered by her popularity, Duke Frederick banishes Rosalind. Celia, devoted to her cousin, decides to flee with her. For safety, Rosalind disguises herself as a young man named "Ganymede," and Celia as a poor shepherdess named "Aliena." They escape to the Forest of Arden with the court jester, Touchstone.
In the Forest of Arden, the banished Duke Senior and his lords live a peaceful, rustic life. Orlando, warned by Adam of Oliver's murderous plot, also flees to the forest. Starving, he stumbles upon Duke Senior's party and is welcomed warmly. Elsewhere in the forest, Rosalind (as Ganymede) and Celia (as Aliena) purchase a cottage. Orlando, now deeply in love, begins leaving love poems for Rosalind on the trees throughout the forest.
Rosalind, still disguised as Ganymede, finds the poems and then meets Orlando himself. She playfully offers to "cure" him of his lovesickness by pretending to be Rosalind, so he can practice wooing her. Orlando agrees to the daily lessons. This central plot is surrounded by other romantic entanglements: the shepherd Silvius is hopelessly in love with the shepherdess Phebe, who scorns him; and the jester Touchstone pursues the simple goatherd, Audrey. When Ganymede intervenes in an argument between Silvius and Phebe, Phebe falls instantly in love with the disguised Rosalind.
Oliver is sent into the forest by Duke Frederick to find Orlando. While there, he is saved from a lioness by Orlando, who is injured in the process. This heroic act causes Oliver to repent his past cruelty, and the brothers reconcile. When Oliver meets Aliena (Celia), they fall in love at first sight and decide to marry.
Seeing the happiness of her cousin and Oliver, Rosalind decides to end her charade. She promises Orlando that he will marry his true Rosalind and tells Phebe that she will marry her if she refuses to marry Silvius. The next day, she reveals her true identity. The play culminates in a grand finale where four couples are wed: Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, Silvius and Phebe (who agrees to marry him once she learns Ganymede is a woman), and Touchstone and Audrey. In a final twist, it is announced that Duke Frederick has had a religious conversion, restored the dukedom to Duke Senior, and retired to a monastery. The rightful order is restored, and the happy couples celebrate before returning to court.
