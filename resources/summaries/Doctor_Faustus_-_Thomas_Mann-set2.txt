Doctor Faustus
Thomas Mann


"Doctor Faustus" by Thomas Mann is a profound and complex literary work that tells the life of the fictional composer Adrian Leverkühn, who makes a pact with the devil to create works of musical genius. The novel is not only a retelling of the Faust legend, but also an examination of German culture and history, in particular the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Thomas Mann weaves philosophical, musical, theological and political themes into this multi-layered work, which is considered one of his greatest literary achievements.
Summary
The narrator, Serenus Zeitblom, and the main character, Adrian Leverkühn, come from the fictional town of Kaisersaschern on the Saale, and their origins and characteristics are reminiscent of the old Germany of the post-medieval period. Zeitblom's father, the pharmacist Wohlgemut, and Adrian's traditional German appearance refer to this old time, possibly even before the Thirty Years' War. Both characters, with Catholic and Lutheran roots and theological backgrounds, seem like descendants of the German Renaissance and the world of artists such as Dürer and Bach. They show an affinity and admiration for the "keen-scented receptivity of Jewish circles".
Wendell Kretzschmar, a German-American musicologist, awakened their interest in music during a visit to Kaisersaschern. After school, they both studied in Halle, with Adrian devoting himself to theology, while Zeitblom did not study theology but took part in theological discussions. Adrian's fascination with musical harmony and mystical numbers led him to Leipzig to study with Kretzschmar.
With a mixture of awe and horror, Zeitblom tells of Adrian's encounter with the woman who infects him with syphilis, a woman whom Adrian calls "Esmeralda", after a butterfly that had captivated his father. Adrian even weaves her name into the musical notation of his compositions. Zeitblom tells of the doctors who tried to cure Adrian but were prevented from doing so by strange and fatal circumstances, and how he himself began to recognize the demonic in Adrian.
Meanwhile, Adrian continues to expand his social network by forming friendships with various characters, including the translator Rüdiger Schildknapp, the talented young violinist Rudi Schwerdtfeger, Mrs. Rodde and her daughters Clarissa and Ines, a coin collector named Dr. Kranich, and the two artists Leo Zink and Baptist Spengler after he moves to Munich.
Zeitblom underlines the special nature of his connection to Adrian by emphasizing that he is the only person who addresses Adrian with a used pronoun. Adrian later finds a permanent home and retreat in Pfeiffering in the countryside, an hour away from Munich, with the Schweigestill family. Although Pfeiffering is fictional, the place is based on the real Bavarian town of Polling.
In 1912, Adrian is living in Palestrina, Italy, with Schildknapp, and Zeitblom pays them a visit. During this time, Adrian, who is working on music for an opera version of Shakespeare's "Love's Labour's Lost", has a long dialog with a Mephistopheles-like figure who is either real or a manifestation of his troubled soul. Zeitblom presents Adrian's manuscript of this conversation in the middle of the narrative, the heart of the story. In it, the demon speaks in ancient German and claims to be using Esmeralda as a means of controlling Adrian. He offers him a 24-year life as a genius, provided he renounces love. This dialog reveals the basic structure of Leverkühn's way of thinking.
Adrian then moves to Pfeiffering permanently and expresses his gloomy outlook on life to Zeitblom. Demonic characters such as Dr. Chaim Breisacher emerge to overthrow the idols of the older generation.
Ines Rodde marries in 1915, but begins an extramarital relationship with Rudi Schwerdtfeger. Meanwhile, Adrian suffers from physical ailments such as retching and migraines, but manages to compose new and finer music, which lays the foundation for his great work, the oratorio "Apocalypsis cum Figuris" (The Apocalypse with Figures). Schwerdtfeger, who interfered in Adrian's solitude, asked him to write a violin concerto, which was to be a symbol of their platonic connection.
In August 1919, Adrian completes the sketch for "Apocalypsis cum Figuris", and a new circle of intellectual friends appears in his life, including the art connoisseur Sextus Kridwiss, the paleozoologist Chaim Breisacher, the literary historian Georg Vogler, the gloomy poet Daniel zur Höhe and the Dürer expert Dr. Holzschuher. Their conversations revolve around the need to shed the softness of bourgeois culture and prepare for a time of pre-medieval harshness. Adrian tells Zeitblom that collectivism is the true counterforce to bourgeois culture, while Zeitblom recognizes aestheticism as a precursor to barbarism.
In 1926, "Apocalypsis cum Figuris" is performed in Frankfurt under the direction of conductor Otto Klemperer. Zeitblom characterizes the work as an expression of a yearning hopelessness that transforms even hellish laughter into transfigured sounds of spheres and angels.
Adrian, who has composed the concerto demanded by Rudi, tries to get out of his contract and find love by using Rudi as a messenger of love. However, the woman chooses Rudi and not Adrian. Shortly afterwards, Ines kills Rudi in a streetcar out of jealousy. In 1928, Adrian begins planning his second oratorio "The Lamentation of Doctor Faustus" and takes in his sister's child, Nepomuk, who calls himself "Echo". The boy is loved by everyone.
While Adrian is working on his massive work, the child falls ill and dies. Adrian is convinced that he has killed the child through his loving gaze and the resulting violation of his contract.
In 1930, the score of the "Lamentation" is finished. Adrian invites friends and guests, but instead of playing the music, he reveals the story of his demonic contract and falls into a brain disease that lasts ten years until his death.
Zeitblom visits him occasionally and survives to witness the end of Germany's "dissolute triumphs" as he tells his friend's story.
