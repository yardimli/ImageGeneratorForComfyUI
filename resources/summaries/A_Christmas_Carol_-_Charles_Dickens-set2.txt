Summary
Chapter One
The story unfolds on a frosty Christmas Eve in London, exactly seven years after the demise of Jacob Marley, the business partner of the ageing and miserly Ebenezer Scrooge. With his aversion to Christmas, Scrooge declines his nephew Fred's invitation to dinner and gives the cold shoulder to two men asking for donations for the needy. He reluctantly grants his exhausted and poorly paid employee Bob Cratchit a paid day off at Christmas to follow tradition.
That night, the ghost of his deceased partner Marley appears to Scrooge, bound in chains and money boxes - symbols of his greedy and selfish existence. Marley warns Scrooge that he risks a similar fate unless he listens to the three spirits who will visit him. Only then can he escape the condemnation of wearing even heavier chains that reflect his own miserly life.
Chapter Two
The Ghost of Christmas Past, the first of the three spirits, takes Scrooge on a journey through past Christmas moments of his childhood and youth. In doing so, Scrooge is reminded of an era when he still possessed innocence and joy. You see Scrooge's lonely days at boarding school, his intimate relationship with his beloved sister Fan, who tragically died giving birth to Fred, and a heartfelt Christmas Eve celebration hosted by Scrooge's former employer, the benevolent Mr. Fezziwig.
The trip also leads to a painful reminder of Scrooge's lost love, Belle, who severed their relationship when she realized that Scrooge's love of money was stronger than his love for her. They visit Belle's present, fulfilled family, now married, on the Christmas Eve that Marley passed away. Deeply touched and upset by Belle's account of what he has become, Scrooge begs the ghost to take him away from this scene.
Chapter Three
The Ghost of Christmas Present, appearing as a second ghost, takes Scrooge to vivid and colorful scenes of a market where people are buying food for their Christmas feast, as well as unusual celebrations in a remote mountain inn and a lonely lighthouse. Together with the ghost, Scrooge also experiences his nephew Fred's merry Christmas party.
Special attention is paid to the modest Christmas celebration of the Cratchit family. Scrooge meets Tiny Tim, the family's youngest son, who despite a serious illness radiates a remarkable zest for life. The ghost tells Scrooge that the little boy will not survive if the present circumstances do not change.
Before the ghost leaves, he reveals to Scrooge two emaciated children, symbols of ignorance and misery. He warns Scrooge urgently of these two evils, reproaching him for his own indifference to the fate of the poor.
Chapter Four
The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the third and final spirit, presents Scrooge with a Christmas future. Without speaking a word, he leads Scrooge through scenes showing the death of an unloved person. Local shopkeepers explain that they will only attend the funeral if a meal is served. The deceased's housekeeper, laundress and funeral director steal his belongings to sell to a fence.
In response to Scrooge's desperate plea to show him someone who shows emotion about this death, the ghost merely reveals a poor couple who are relieved that the creditor's death will buy them time to pay off their debts. In another heartbreaking moment, the ghost leads Scrooge to the Cratchits, who are mourning the death of Tiny Tim.
Finally, the ghost reveals an abandoned and unkempt grave with Scrooge's name carved on the stone. In tears, Scrooge swears that he will change his life and become a better person.
Chapter Five
Scrooge wakes up on Christmas Day with a new attitude to life. He becomes generous and compassionate, rejecting the cold, greedy person he once was. To show his goodwill, he donates a sizable sum to the charity he had previously rejected and secretly orders a sumptuous turkey for the Cratchits to enrich their feast.
Instead of spending the day alone, he accepts the invitation from his nephew Fred and celebrates with his family. The following working day, he surprises Bob Cratchit with a pay rise and becomes a supportive and loving father figure to Tiny Tim.
In the years that follow, Scrooge lives in harmony with the lessons he has learned from the ghosts and becomes a symbol of kindness, goodness and the true spirit of Christmas.
