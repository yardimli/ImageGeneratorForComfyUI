Summary
During the Great Depression in California, two migrant workers find themselves on the road: George Milton, smart but without formal education, and Lennie Small, physically tall and strong but mentally challenged. The two are on their way from Soledad to another place in the state to one day fulfill their dream of owning their own tract of land and farm. Lennie's part of this dream involves raising and caring for rabbits on the farm, as he loves the touch of soft things. However, this keeps ending in tragedy as he accidentally kills them. They were forced to escape from Weed, California after Lennie held onto a woman's skirt and refused to release it, causing her to accuse him of rape. It quickly becomes clear that George is acting as Lennie's protector.
After being hired at a ranch, they are confronted by Curley, the ranch owner's young, hostile son who has a Napoleon complex. Curley sets his sights on Lennie because he doesn't like bigger men. In addition, Curley's flirtatious wife, to whom Lennie is immediately attracted, becomes a danger. On the other hand, the duo befriend Candy, an older, one-handed laborer, and Slim, a wise and compassionate skinner. Slim's dog has recently had puppies, and Slim gives one of the puppies to Lennie and Candy, whose old dog was euthanized by another worker named Carlson.
Despite various difficulties, their dream comes closer when Candy agrees to contribute 350 dollars so that they can buy the farm at the end of the month in exchange for letting him live there. The three of them are thrilled at the prospect, but their joy is dampened when Curley attacks Lennie. Under George's orders, Lennie fights back by effortlessly crushing Curley's hand.
George feels somewhat relieved after the incident with Curley and leaves Lennie at the ranch while he goes into town with the other workers. Lennie, who strays into the stable, meets Crooks, the black, educated and lonely stable hand who lives apart from the other workers. When Candy joins them, the three of them discuss their farm plans. Although Crooks initially scoffs at the plan, he eventually shows interest and asks to be allowed to hoe a garden bed. Suddenly Curley's wife appears and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, she becomes vicious, insults the men and threatens to lynch Crooks. When they hear that the other workers are coming back, they leave the stable.
The next day, something disastrous happens: Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife finds him in the barn and begins to talk to him. She confesses her loneliness and broken dreams to him before allowing Lennie to stroke her hair. However, when she feels his immense strength and begins to scream, Lennie panics and breaks her neck. He flees while the other ranch hands find the body and form a lynch mob.
George, realizing that the dream of the ranch is now out of reach, sets out to find Lennie at the agreed emergency location. He finds him there, and the two remember their dream once again. George, hearing the lynch mob approaching, kills Lennie to give him a more merciful end. When Curley, Slim and Carlson arrive, only Slim understands the tragedy of what has happened and comforts George. Curley and Carlson are left behind, unable to understand their own emotions.
