The Return of the Native
Thomas Hardy
"The Return of the Native" by Thomas Hardy is a tragic novel of character and environment, exploring the powerful and often destructive forces of love, fate, and ambition. Set on the wild and somber expanse of Egdon Heath in southern England, the story follows Clym Yeobright, who returns to his native land with idealistic plans, and Eustacia Vye, a passionate and rebellious woman who yearns to escape the very world Clym embraces. Their doomed marriage becomes the centerpiece of a narrative that weaves together themes of chance, the conflict between rural and urban values, and the struggle of individuals against an indifferent, overwhelming nature.

Summary
The novel begins in the twilight on Egdon Heath, a barren plain made eerie by bonfires celebrating the Fifth of November. In a wagon driven by Diggory Venn, a reddleman whose skin is stained from his trade, sits Thomasin Yeobright. Venn, who once loved Thomasin, is bringing her home from a canceled wedding to the carefree tavern owner, Damon Wildeve. Thomasin’s aunt, the formidable Mrs. Yeobright, confronts Wildeve, who blames a problem with the marriage license and renews his promise to marry Thomasin. However, later that night, Wildeve secretly meets with Eustacia Vye, a proud and mysterious young woman with whom he shares a romantic past. Despite Venn’s attempts to keep them apart for Thomasin’s sake, Eustacia considers fleeing Egdon with Wildeve, though her love for him is uncertain, especially with the news that Mrs. Yeobright’s son, Clym, is returning from a successful career in Paris.

Eustacia's interest in Clym grows as she hears tales of his charm. Determined to meet him, she disguises herself to act in a Christmas folk play performed at the Yeobrights’ home. She is entranced by Clym, who remains unaware of her identity. Following this encounter, she definitively ends her relationship with Wildeve, who then hastily marries Thomasin, though his passion for Eustacia still flickers.

Clym, having abandoned his career as a diamond merchant in Paris because he found the life overly sophisticated, decides to remain on Egdon Heath and establish a school for the poor, a plan that greatly disappoints his mother. He arranges to meet the mysterious Eustacia, and they quickly fall in love, marrying despite their opposing desires—his to stay on the heath, hers to escape it. They move into an isolated cottage, and Clym throws himself into his studies for his new teaching method. Meanwhile, Mrs. Yeobright decides to give her son and niece their inheritances. Wildeve, who has been neglecting Thomasin, learns of this and tricks the peasant delivering the money into gambling it all away to him. The ever-watchful Venn witnesses the deception and, in an intense dice game on the dark heath, wins all the money back from Wildeve, delivering it to Thomasin.

A bitter misunderstanding leads Mrs. Yeobright to believe Eustacia is in league with Wildeve and has accepted money from him, causing a severe rift between the two women. Eustacia pleads with Clym to move to Paris, but her discontent only drives him to study harder. The intense strain ruins his eyesight, forcing him to abandon his teaching plans and take up work as a common furze-cutter on the heath, a source of deep shame for Eustacia. She renews her connection with Wildeve at a dance, though Venn continually frustrates their meetings. Mrs. Yeobright, encouraged by Venn, decides to reconcile with her son and daughter-in-law. On a hot summer day, she walks to their cottage and sees Clym asleep inside. As she approaches, she also sees another man—Wildeve—enter. When she knocks, no one answers, though she glimpses Eustacia’s face at a window. Inside, Eustacia, believing Clym has answered the door, hides with Wildeve. Heartbroken and feeling rejected, Mrs. Yeobright rushes away. Exhausted by the heat, she is bitten by an adder and collapses, telling a young boy she encounters that she has been cast off by her son before she dies.

Devastated by guilt over his mother's death, Clym is initially unaware that she had tried to visit him. Eustacia, tormented, remains silent about what happened. Gradually, Clym learns the truth from Venn and the peasant boy. He confronts Eustacia, suspecting Wildeve was the man in the cottage. All their frustrations erupt in a bitter argument, and Eustacia confesses to not opening the door but refuses to name Wildeve. They separate, with Eustacia returning to her grandfather’s house in suicidal despair and Clym moving back to his mother’s home.

Exactly one year after the novel’s opening, Wildeve finds Eustacia and agrees to help her flee abroad. That same night, Clym, spurred on by Thomasin, writes Eustacia a letter of reconciliation, but it arrives after she has already left to meet Wildeve. Hearing of their plan, Clym searches for them on the stormy heath. He finds Wildeve near the tavern and, as they argue, they hear a body fall into the swollen nearby river. Both men plunge in after Eustacia. Venn, who has encountered a frantic Thomasin, rushes to the river. He manages to pull Clym from the water, but Wildeve and Eustacia have both drowned.

In the aftermath, Thomasin, now a widow with a child and a large inheritance, moves in with Clym. Venn, having given up his wandering trade to become a farmer, begins to court her. Though Clym briefly considers marrying his cousin, he steps aside when he learns she plans to marry Venn. Believing himself responsible for the deaths of his mother and his wife, Clym spends the rest of his days as an itinerant preacher, delivering moral sermons on the vast and forbidding heath.
