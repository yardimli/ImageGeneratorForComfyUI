As I Lay Dying
William Faulkner

"As I Lay Dying" by William Faulkner is a landmark of American modernism and one of the most influential novels of the 20th century. The story chronicles the grotesque and tragicomic journey of the impoverished Bundren family to transport the body of their deceased matriarch, Addie, to her hometown of Jefferson for burial. The novel is renowned for its experimental narrative structure, employing a stream-of-consciousness technique with 15 different narrators to explore themes of death, family dysfunction, and the subjective nature of reality.
Summary
In rural Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, Addie Bundren is on her deathbed. Her eldest son, Cash, meticulously builds her coffin outside her window. The family has promised to honor her wish to be buried 40 miles away in Jefferson. Her husband, Anse, allows the other sons, Darl and Jewel, to take a final delivery job for a neighbor. As Addie dies, the family's individual, often selfish, motivations begin to surface. Her daughter, Dewey Dell, is secretly pregnant and hopes to find an abortionist in town. The youngest son, the mentally troubled Vardaman, conflates his mother's death with a fish he caught, famously concluding, "My mother is a fish." In his confusion, he drills holes into the coffin lid to let her breathe, accidentally boring into her face. After three days, with the body already beginning to smell, the family finally sets out on their journey.

The journey is immediately beset by disaster. The main bridge to Jefferson has been washed out by a flood, forcing them on a long detour. When they attempt to ford a swollen river, a log capsizes their wagon. The family's mules drown, and Cash's leg is badly broken. Darl and Jewel manage to rescue the coffin and Cash’s precious tools from the raging water. Exhausted, they take shelter at a nearby farm while Anse sets off to acquire a new team of mules. During this delay, the narrative delves into the past through the memories of Addie herself, revealing her loveless marriage to Anse, her affair with the local preacher Reverend Whitfield (who is Jewel's real father), and her deep-seated cynicism about the emptiness of words.

The journey continues after Anse callously trades Jewel’s beloved horse for a new team of mules. The stench from the coffin is now so foul that the family is met with outrage and disgust in the town of Mottson, where they are forced to leave by the sheriff. Dewey Dell is rebuffed in her attempt to buy abortion drugs from an ethical pharmacist. They spend the night in a barn belonging to a man named Gillespie. Here, the sensitive and increasingly unhinged Darl, hoping to give his mother a clean end by fire, sets the barn ablaze. Jewel, in a heroic effort, saves the coffin from the flames but is badly burned in the process.

Finally arriving in Jefferson, the family manages to bury Addie. However, the resolution of their quest only leads to the family's complete disintegration. For his act of arson, Darl is declared insane by his own family and forcibly taken away to an asylum. Dewey Dell is tricked by an unscrupulous drug store clerk who takes her money and sexually assaults her under the guise of providing "treatment." Cash's leg, set in a crude cement cast by Anse, has developed gangrene and will leave him permanently crippled. In a final, shocking twist, Anse, having achieved his own secret goals, reappears with a new set of false teeth and a new wife, whom he introduces to his stunned children as "the new Mrs. Bundren."
