The Bluest Eye
Toni Morrison
"The Bluest Eye" by Toni Morrison is a powerful and devastating exploration of beauty, race, and self-hatred in 1940s America. The novel tells the tragic story of Pecola Breedlove, a young black girl who believes that having blue eyes would make her beautiful and loved. Through Pecola's heartbreaking journey, Morrison exposes the destructive impact of white beauty standards on black identity and examines how internalized racism can destroy lives and families from within.
Summary
The story unfolds through the voice of Claudia MacTeer, an adult black woman reflecting on events from the fall of 1941 in Lorain, Ohio. The memory of this time continues to haunt her because there are no answers to explain what happened. Pecola Breedlove, a friend of Claudia and her sister Frieda, became pregnant with her own father's child, suddenly shattering their childhood innocence. While they knew that men could become violent when drunk and commit terrible acts, neither Claudia nor Frieda had ever known anyone whose father had raped his own daughter. They hoped desperately that the baby would be healthy and strong, secretly planting marigold seeds in the belief that if the flowers bloomed, there might be hope for Pecola's child. But the marigolds never grew, and Claudia came to believe that the earth itself was rejecting this abominable crime against nature.
Autumn brings memories of dead grass, heavy stockings, castor oil, and chest-tightening phlegm for Claudia. Yet during her painful nighttime coughing fits, her mother was always there—someone who did not want her to die. Pecola Breedlove has never experienced such basic maternal care. When her father Cholly burned down their house in a drunken rage, county officials placed Pecola with the MacTeer family. To be "outdoors"—without a home—was the worst fate Claudia could imagine. Their guest had suffered the ultimate calamity, so Frieda brought her crackers on a plate and milk in a blue-and-white Shirley Temple cup.
Mrs. MacTeer becomes puzzled by the enormous quantities of milk Pecola consumes, but the girls understand why: Pecola will do anything to hold that cup and gaze adoringly at Shirley Temple's dimpled white prettiness. One restless Saturday, as the girls sit on the porch steps while Mrs. MacTeer continues fuming about Pecola's milk consumption, blood suddenly runs down Pecola's legs as she begins menstruating. This biological milestone becomes crucial to the novel's tragedy—when her father later rapes her, the horror is compounded by the knowledge that she could become pregnant, which she does.
That night, as the three girls talk in bed, Pecola marvels that she can now have a baby. Frieda confirms this but adds that first "someone has to love you." Puzzled, Pecola asks the question at the core of her desire for blue eyes: "How do you get somebody to love you?" She is eleven years old and feels utterly unloved.
The Breedloves find new lodging with two rooms—three beds in one room, a coal stove in the middle, and a front living room containing a tiny artificial Christmas tree. Morrison observes that the coal stove is the only living thing in the Breedlove house. Saturday mornings typically bring the same dysfunction: Cholly arrives home drunk, Pauline complains about the lack of heat, and they threaten each other with violence. Morrison characterizes their relationship as mutually, perversely satisfying—Pauline can feel martyred by her husband's excesses while Cholly can hate himself less by hurting her instead.
During these fights, Pecola's brother Sammy either flees or cheers them on, while Pecola hides beneath a quilt, praying to God to make her disappear. She begins to believe that she sees ugliness everywhere because she has ugly eyes. If she had pretty blue eyes, she reasons, she would see beautiful things and people would treat her kindly. Her prayers for blue eyes intensify, and just as she consumes milk while staring at Shirley Temple's image, she now buys Mary Jane candies for the picture on the wrapper, treating them like Communion wafers—consuming the essence of Mary Jane's sweet blue eyes.
Winter introduces Maureen Peal, a new student who dazzles everyone with her fur-trimmed coat, shiny shoes, and fancy clothes. As a light-skinned black girl, she knows that some blacks consider her more beautiful because of her complexion. Unlike other children, Claudia, Frieda, and Pecola haven't been captivated by Maureen's "two lynch ropes" of braids. Perhaps because the girls haven't bowed to her superiority, Maureen seeks them out.
When a circle of boys tries to intimidate the girls walking home from school, Frieda threatens them, but it's Maureen's springtime eyes that make them retreat. Maureen slips her arm through Pecola's and buys her ice cream, then begins talking compulsively about naked men—particularly naked fathers. Knowing that schoolchildren tease Pecola about probably seeing Cholly naked, Claudia swings at Maureen, misses, and accidentally hits Pecola. The light-skinned girl jerks away and taunts them from across the street, braying that she's cute and they're ugly.
Later, the girls spy through their window on their boarder Mr. Henry cavorting with two neighborhood prostitutes, watching him flash his naked legs beneath his dressing gown while sucking China's fingers. Claudia closes her narration here, and Morrison takes over to tell a strange, sadistic story involving Pecola, a glossy black cat with blue eyes, and a rambunctious boy named Louis Jr.
Morrison introduces Geraldine, one of those black women who straighten their hair and don't smoke, drink, or swear. These women patiently endure rather than enjoy sex, follow rigid schedules, keep immaculate houses, often own cats they treat with more affection than their children, while dryly reminding their only child about neglected chores. Geraldine has the requisite cat and child—Louis Jr., who deeply resents his perfect mother's attempts to keep him clean and has turned into a bully.
Seeing Pecola crossing his school playground, Louis Jr. promises to show her kittens and coaxes her into his mother's house. As Pecola admires dark red flowers, he throws his mother's cat at her, leaving her speechless. Stooping to rub the cat's head, she's caught by the icy deep blue of its eyes. Junior seizes the cat and flings it against the window, killing it just as the immaculate Geraldine opens the door. Pecola is blamed for the cat's death as Geraldine screams at the "little black bitch" to get out. All her life, Geraldine has feared people like Pecola—ugly, dark black people she considers disgusting and squalid. Snow falls as Pecola walks home, trying to shield her face from the stinging cold air and heated cries of rejection.
Spring 1941 brings memories of the long, thin forsythia twigs used for whipping. Claudia was thinking of these painful episodes when she found her sister Frieda lying on the bed, whimpering. Initially assuming Frieda had been beaten with fresh switches, Claudia discovers that the budding spring season parallels Frieda's budding breasts—which Mr. Henry has fondled. The MacTeers react with outrage: Mr. MacTeer throws a bicycle at Henry, knocking him off the porch; Mrs. MacTeer hits him with a broom; Mr. MacTeer fires a gun at him. Their fury over someone taking such liberties with a young girl contrasts dramatically with Pauline and Cholly's reaction when they realize their daughter has been raped by Cholly himself.
Claudia and Frieda set out for Cholly's house seeking whiskey but learn that Pecola has gone to the white family's house where her mother works. There, Pauline cautions them not to touch anything. When Pecola spills a pan of blueberry cobbler, burning her legs, the petite Fisher daughter begins crying. Pauline rushes to soothe the white child's tears while ignoring Pecola's painful, burned flesh.
Morrison, as omniscient narrator, provides Pauline Williams Breedlove's history: the ninth of eleven children who grew up in Alabama, stepped on a rusty nail as a child, and limped ever since. When the family migrated to Kentucky, Pauline cared for the twins, Chicken and Pie. Maturing into puberty, she dreamed of a nebulous "Someone" who would lay her head on his chest and carry her somewhere wondrous forever. Her Mr. Someone appeared as Cholly Breedlove, whistling with the hot Kentucky sun at his back, bending down to tickle her broken foot and kiss her leg.
After marrying and moving north to Lorain, Ohio, where Cholly would work in a steel mill, Pauline felt uncomfortable with northern blacks. She couldn't wear their high-heeled shoes or straighten her hair as they did, and they spoke differently. Taking jobs as a day worker gave her money for new clothes while Cholly spent his earnings on alcohol, becoming meaner each month. During her first pregnancy, Pauline often attended movies, marveling at handsome white men caring for their beautiful white wives in this fantasy world.
After Sammy's birth and her second pregnancy, with Cholly's drinking continuing, Pauline secured work with the well-to-do Fisher family, where she could arrange their beautiful possessions. She began neglecting her own house, children, and husband. The Fishers bragged that "their Polly" was the "ideal servant," and Pauline cherished their praise. She muses that she would have left her alcoholic husband long ago, except that sex with him used to make her "wilt." Though this sensation no longer occurs, missing it seems easier than moving on.
Morrison then provides Cholly Breedlove's devastating childhood history. When only days old, his mother wrapped him in newspaper and two blankets and abandoned him on a junk pile near railroad tracks. His Great Aunt Jimmy accidentally discovered the bundle and rescued Cholly, never allowing his mother to see the baby again. After finishing sixth grade, Cholly did odd jobs and spent time with an old man named Blue Jack, who entertained him with stories.
Barely in his teens, Cholly was introduced to sex by a seductive girl named Darlene, but two white men with a flashlight discovered them in the pine needles, laughing uproariously and ordering them to continue while they watched. Cholly was mortified. Later, fearing Darlene might be pregnant and despite his father having vanished before his birth, he decided he must find his father, Solomon Fuller. He bought a child's bus ticket to Macon, Georgia, and watched his state disappear into the night.
Awakening near their destination, Cholly found his father gambling with other men at an alley's end. Stammering and unable to explain his presence, his father guessed his purpose and cursed him, ordering him to leave. Succumbing to diarrhea, Cholly soiled himself and ran to the river for cleansing. After this symbolic rebirth, he spent time getting drunk, was forced to work on a chain gang, and suffered a bullet wound in his leg. Having nothing left to lose after his father's rejection, it's little wonder he never learned to be an emotionally protective father when he actually became one.
Moving several years forward, the narrative shows Cholly returning home drunk one night to discover his eleven-year-old daughter at the kitchen sink, one foot absently scratching the other leg. Drunkenly mistaking Pecola for his wife Pauline, Cholly crawls toward her and catches her foot, causing her to fall. Realizing his mistake but unable to stop himself, he commits the forbidden and wild act of raping his daughter.
A few months later, Pecola desperately seeks blue eyes from Elihue Micah Whitcomb, known as Soaphead Church—an eccentric faith healer and dream interpreter. For the first time in his fraudulent life, Soaphead wishes he could perform miracles. He tells Pecola she must make an offering to the Lord, and if He grants her wish, He will give her blue eyes. The offering involves Old Bob, a sickly dog on the porch. Soaphead gives Pecola secretly poisoned meat, telling her that if the dog eats it and behaves strangely, God will grant her wish in one day. Bob gulps the fetid meat and within minutes collapses in spasms. Pecola's wish will be granted.
Summer finds Claudia and Frieda selling marigold seeds to earn money. Knocking on doors and entering houses, they listened to conversations and gradually pieced together the awful truth: Pecola Breedlove was pregnant with her father's child. Apparently, Pecola offered no resistance, and her mother beat her afterward. Claudia and Frieda felt sorry and ashamed for both Pecola and the baby. Instinctively knowing the baby would be very black and very ugly, Claudia desperately wanted it born to counterbalance all the pretty pink-skinned, yellow-haired white babies who looked like Shirley Temple. When they heard someone say it would be a miracle if the baby lived, Claudia decided they should perform their own miracle by planting marigold seeds and working magic.
A stream-of-consciousness section suggests that Pecola, desperate for a perfect friend like Jane from the Dick and Jane primer, has created an imaginary companion who doesn't exist. This friend listens to Pecola and admires her "really, truly, bluely nice" eyes. Here we learn about Cholly's second rape of Pecola while she was reading on the couch, and that Pauline never believed in Pecola's innocence. Like Claudia and Frieda, this imaginary friend threatens to leave because Pecola obsesses over whether someone might have even bluer eyes than hers.
Claudia's voice returns as she comments on Pecola's fate—walking the streets, flailing her arms as if trying to fly into a sky the color of the bluest eyes—all because she yearned to be a pretty little white girl instead of a plain black girl called "ugly" and therefore unlovable. The marigolds never grew, the baby was born and died, and Pecola retreated into madness, forever convinced she possesses the blue eyes she desperately sought. In the end, Claudia reflects that perhaps they were too harsh in their desire for miracles, and that the earth itself was unyielding—not because it was hostile, but because it knew that some seeds are planted in the wrong season, in soil that cannot nourish them.Add to Conversation
