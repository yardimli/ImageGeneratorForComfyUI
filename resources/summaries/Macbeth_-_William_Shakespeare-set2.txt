Macbeth
William Shakespeare


"Macbeth" by William Shakespeare is one of the famous playwright's shortest yet most intense tragedies, exploring the depths of human nature and the consequences of lust for power, guilt and betrayal in a powerful way. Written in the early 17th century, the play tells the rise and fall of Macbeth, a Scottish general who, driven by lust for power and influenced by the prophecies of three witches and the ambitions of his wife, murders the king in order to ascend the throne himself.
Summary
Act One
The play begins with three witches casting a spell and planning their next meeting, where they intend to meet Macbeth. In the scene that follows, Duncan, the King of Scotland, discusses with his officers the successful repulse of the invasion of Scotland by the Norwegians and Irish led by the rebellious Macdonald. Macbeth, Thane of Glamis and cousin of the king, has distinguished himself in this battle. Duncan decides to reward Macbeth for his bravery with the title Thane of Cawdor.
As Macbeth and his companion Banquo ride from the battlefield to Forres, they encounter the witches. They greet Macbeth first as Thane of Glamis, then as Thane of Cawdor and finally prophesy that he will one day be king. They also predict to Banquo that his descendants will be kings. When Macbeth asks the witches to explain the meaning of their prophecies, they disappear. Shortly afterwards, an emissary from the king appears and informs Macbeth of his appointment as Thane of Cawdor.
As the witches' first prophecy has been fulfilled, Macbeth begins to covet the throne. He writes a letter to his wife in Inverness, telling her about the witches' prophecies. When Lady Macbeth reads the letter, she immediately develops a plan to assassinate King Duncan in order to make her husband king. Macbeth arrives at the castle unexpectedly and at the same time receives the news that Duncan will be spending the night there. Lady Macbeth informs him of her murder plan. Macbeth hesitates at first, but his wife spurs him on and strengthens his ambition to carry out the plan.
Act Two
The next morning, the crime is discovered and Macbeth accuses Duncan's servants, whom he murdered earlier, allegedly in a fit of rage to avenge the king's death. Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, who are also in the castle, doubt Macbeth's account of what happened, but agree so as not to become victims too. Malcolm escapes to England, while Donalbain flees to Ireland.
Due to his relationship with the late King Duncan and the flight of his sons, Macbeth is proclaimed King of Scotland, thus fulfilling the second prophecy of the witches.
Act Three
Despite his rise to kingship, Macbeth is still troubled by the witches' prophecies, especially the prediction that Banquo will be the father of kings. He therefore commissions assassins to kill Banquo and his son Fleance when they come to the castle to attend a banquet to which Macbeth has invited them. The assassins manage to kill Banquo, but Fleance manages to get away. Shortly after Macbeth learns from the murderers what has happened, Banquo's ghost appears during the banquet and takes Macbeth's place. Only Macbeth can see the ghost and speaks to him, his words revealing his crime.
Act Four
Macbeth returns to the scene of his first encounter with the witches and asks them anxiously about his future. The witches conjure up three spirits. The first spirit warns him to beware of Macduff, the loyal Thane of Fife. The second prophesies that no man born of a woman can defeat Macbeth. The third predicts that Macbeth will remain unharmed until the Great Birnam Wood moves towards Dunsinane Hill.
Although these strange prophecies initially reassure Macbeth, his uncertainty does not diminish. He demands to know whether Banquo's descendants will take over as predicted by the witches. In response, the spirits of eight kings appear, followed by the spirit of Banquo, who holds a mirror showing that Banquo's descendants will indeed become kings of Scotland. Shortly afterwards, a vassal tells him that Macduff has fled. In retaliation, Macbeth decides to attack Macduff's castle and kill his entire family.
The action shifts to England, where Macduff, still unaware of his family's fate, meets Malcolm, Duncan's son. He tries to persuade Malcolm to return to Scotland and take the throne. At this moment, Macduff learns of his family's death.
Act Five
Lady Macbeth is plagued by remorse and sleepwalkingly tries to wash imaginary bloodstains from her hands. Meanwhile, Malcolm and Macduff invade Scotland with the support of the English Earl Siward of Northumberland. They attack Dunsinane Castle, disguised with branches from the Great Birnam Wood, fulfilling one of the witches' prophecies. Macbeth learns of the forest attack and of his wife's suicide. After a nihilistic monologue, he is determined to fight to the end.
After killing Siward's son, Macbeth is confronted by Macduff. Although he still feels safe because of the witches' prophecy, Macduff reveals that he was not born naturally, but that his mother died shortly before his birth and he was born by caesarean section. This fulfills the prophecy that Macbeth could not be killed by a man born of a woman. Macbeth realizes that the witches' prophecies had a hidden meaning. Macduff then kills Macbeth and decapitates him. In the final scene, Malcolm is crowned King of Scotland. The prophecy about the royal fate of Banquo's sons was known to Shakespeare's contemporaries, as King James I of England was considered a descendant of Banquo.
