Summary
Gregor Samsa awakens one morning to find that he has been transformed into a giant, hideous beetle. At first he believes the transformation will only be temporary and lets his mind wander about the effects of this transformation. As he lies on his back and is unable to leave his bed, he thinks about his work as a traveling salesman and fabric seller. He finds his job superficial and his relationship with people volatile and unapproachable. He regards his employer as a tyrant and would gladly give up the job if he wasn't the sole breadwinner for his family and didn't have to pay off his bankrupt father's debts.
While Gregor is thinking about this, he notices that his office supervisor has come to check on him. The supervisor is furious about Gregor's unexcused absence. Gregor tries to speak to both him and his family, but all that can be heard behind the door are unintelligible noises. With great difficulty, Gregor crawls across the floor and opens the door to show himself to them. The supervisor, terrified at the sight of the transformed Gregor, takes flight. Gregor's family react with horror and his father forces him back into his room, injuring Gregor in the side when he gets stuck in the door.
Gregor's surprising transformation causes his family a financial crisis as he is no longer able to work for them. He is locked in his room and gradually accepts his new existence and gets used to his changed body. His sister Grete is the only one willing to look after him and brings him food, which he only likes when it is rotten. Gregor spends his days climbing walls and ceilings. When Grete notices that Gregor enjoys this crawling, she decides to clear out his room to give him more freedom of movement.
Together with her mother, she begins to remove the furniture from the room, leaving only the sofa under which Gregor hides when visitors come. But Gregor finds this approach disturbing, as he is afraid of losing his human past. He desperately clings to a beloved portrait of a woman in a fur coat in order to save it. The sight of Gregor on the wall makes his mother faint. In the excitement that follows, Gregor is slightly injured when Grete drops a bottle, which breaks. When his father comes home and realizes the situation, he reacts angrily and throws apples at Gregor. One of them hits him on the back and sticks, causing a serious injury.
Gregor's injuries affect him for the rest of his life and he eats less and less. Meanwhile, his father, mother and sister find jobs and take less and less care of him. His room gradually turns into a storeroom. Although the family initially opens the door for Gregor in the evenings so that he can hear their conversations, this practice diminishes when they rent a room to three men. Gregor's existence remains hidden from them.
One day, the cleaning lady, who occasionally checks on Gregor, carelessly leaves his door open. Gregor, attracted by the sounds of Grete's violin, crawls out but is discovered by the tenants. Disgusted by the unsanitary conditions, they complain and threaten to leave without pay and take legal action. Grete, tired of caring for Gregor and realizing how he is a burden on the family, declares that they must get rid of him. Gregor, hearing these words, retreats to his room in defeat and dies of hunger before sunrise.
The cleaning lady finds his lifeless body, informs the family and takes care of the disposal of the corpse. Relieved of the burden, the father, mother and Grete take time off and drive to the countryside. They think about moving to a smaller and cheaper apartment. During the trip, the parents notice that Grete has grown into an attractive young woman despite the hardships and begin to think about the possibility of marriage.
