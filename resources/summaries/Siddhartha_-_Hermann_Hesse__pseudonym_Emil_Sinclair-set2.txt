Summary
The story is set in the ancient Nepalese kingdom of Kapilavastu. Siddhartha decides to leave his homeland in the hope of attaining spiritual enlightenment by becoming an ascetic, wandering mendicant of Samana. Together with his best friend Govinda, Siddhartha fasts, becomes homeless, renounces all personal possessions and meditates intensively until he finally seeks out Gautama, the famous Buddha, the enlightened one, and speaks to him personally. Afterwards, both Siddhartha and Govinda show their appreciation for his wisdom. Although Govinda hurries to join the Buddha's order, Siddhartha does not follow him, claiming that although the Buddha's philosophy is extremely wise, it does not do justice to the inevitably different experiences of each person. He argues that the individual seeks an absolutely unique, personal meaning that cannot be conveyed to him by a teacher. He therefore decides to continue his search alone.
Siddhartha crosses a river and, unable to pay the kind ferryman, receives a cheerful prediction from him that Siddhartha will one day return to the river to repay him in some manner. On the way to the city, Siddhartha meets Kamala, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Kamala, a courtesan, notices Siddhartha's beautiful looks and quick wit and tells him that he must become wealthy to win her affection so that she can teach him the art of love. Although as a samana Siddhartha despised materialistic pursuits, he now goes along with Kamala's suggestions. She refers him to Kamaswami, a local businessman, and insists that Kamaswami treat him as an equal and not as a subordinate. Siddhartha easily gets his way by countering Kamaswami's passionate fits with a voice of patience and calm that Siddhartha has learned in his time as an ascetic. Thus Siddhartha becomes a wealthy man and Kamala's lover, although in his middle years he realizes that the luxurious lifestyle he has chosen is merely a game that lacks spiritual fulfillment.
Siddhartha leaves the fast-paced city and returns to the river, weary of life and disillusioned. He contemplates suicide before falling into a meditative sleep and is only saved by an inner experience of the sacred word "Om". The next morning, Siddhartha briefly meets Govinda again, who is wandering the countryside as a wandering Buddhist. Siddhartha chooses to live out his remaining years beside the spiritually uplifting river. This is how Siddhartha meets the ferryman named Vasudeva again, with whom he begins a more modest way of life. Although Vasudeva is a simple man, he understands and tells that the river has many voices and important messages that it communicates to anyone who will listen.
A few years later, Kamala, who has since converted to Buddhism, travels to the Buddha's deathbed accompanied by her reluctant young son, but is bitten by a poisonous snake near Siddhartha's river. Siddhartha recognizes her and comes to the realization that the boy is his son. After Kamala's death, Siddhartha tries to comfort and educate the unruly boy until one day the child escapes completely. Although Siddhartha desperately tries to find his runaway son, Vasudeva urges him to let the boy find his own way, just as Siddhartha himself did in his youth. As he listens to the river with Vasudeva, Siddhartha realizes that time is an illusion and that all his feelings and experiences, even those of suffering, are part of a great and ultimately jubilant communion of all things connected in the cyclic unity of nature. After Siddhartha's moment of enlightenment, Vasudeva declares that his work is done and he must go into the forest, leaving Siddhartha peacefully fulfilled and alone once more.
Towards the end of his life, Govinda hears of an enlightened ferryman and travels to Siddhartha, whom he does not initially recognize as his old childhood friend. Govinda asks the now elderly Siddhartha to share his wisdom with him, and Siddhartha replies that for every true statement, there is an opposite statement that is also true; that language and the limitations of time cause people to cling to a fixed belief that does not reflect the fullness of truth. Since nature functions in a self-perpetuating cycle, every entity carries the potential for its opposite, and so the world must always be seen as complete. Siddhartha simply asks people to recognize and love the world in its completeness. Siddhartha then requests that Govinda kiss him on the forehead. When Govinda does so, he experiences visions of timelessness, similar to those Siddhartha saw alongside Vasudeva by the river. Govinda bows before his wise friend, who smiles radiantly, having found enlightenment. Thus he experiences the whole cycle of life. He realizes the importance and love of his father when he himself becomes a father and his own son leaves him to explore the world.
