The Name of the Rose
Umberto Eco


"The Name of the Rose" by Umberto Eco is a complex and intellectually stimulating novel that combines historical fiction with elements of the detective novel and philosophical discussions. This masterful work is set in the 14th century in an Italian Benedictine monastery where Brother William of Baskerville, accompanied by his novice Adso, is called upon to investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Eco's novel is both an homage to Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and a deep exploration of medieval philosophy, theology and the political intrigue of the time.
Summary
In 1327, the Franciscan monk William of Baskerville and his companion, the Benedictine novice Adso of Melk, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in northern Italy. Their arrival coincides with a theological debate between Pope John XXII and the Franciscans on apostolic poverty, with the monastery serving as a neutral ground for the discussion.
The death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator known for his comic illustrations, especially on religious themes, shakes the community. The abbot of the monastery, Abo of Fossanova, commissions William to investigate the death. In the process, William gets into an argument with the abbey's oldest monk, Jorge of Burgos, about the importance of laughter in theology, which Jorge rejects.
Another mysterious death occurs when Venantius of Salvemec, an expert on Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic texts, is found dead in a barrel full of pig's blood. The herbalist Severinus of Sankt Wendel points out to William that the corpse has black spots on the tongue and fingers, which are signs of poisoning. Subsequently, William learns from Benno of Uppsala, a book lover, of a complicated love affair between the librarian Malachi of Hildesheim and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, which led to Adelmo's suicide out of religious shame after Adelmo was seduced by Berengar.
Further investigations lead William and Adso into the monastery's confusing library, where they find clues to a secret room called "finis Africae". On Venantius' desk they discover a book and enigmatic notes, but the book is stolen before they can examine it more closely. Despite their efforts, they are unable to track down the thief.
The following day, Berengar is nowhere to be found, which puts William under additional stress. He discovers that the cellar monks Salvatore of Montferrat and Remigius had links to heretics. Adso later goes to the library alone and is seduced by a peasant girl as he leaves through the kitchen, giving him his first sexual experience. After a confession to William, he is forgiven, although feelings of guilt remain.
The fourth day brings the drowned corpse of Berengar to light, with poison stains similar to those on Venantius. Bernard Gui, an inquisitor, arrives on papal orders to track down the murderer. He arrests both the peasant girl who seduced Adso and Salvatore after catching them with objects for love spells and accuses them of witchcraft.
The following day, Severinus is found dead, bludgeoned to death by a heavy armillary sphere after receiving a mysterious book. William and Adso set off in search of the book. It is found by Benno, who then accepts Malachis' offer to become an assistant librarian. At a court hearing, Gui succeeds in forcing Remigius to make a false confession. Remigius, Salvatore and the peasant girl are taken away and seem doomed to die. The recent tragedies prompt Jorge to preach a sermon about the Antichrist.
Malachi returns on the sixth day and is close to death. His last words are about scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, a glassmaker, reveals to William that the librarian is destined to be the next abbot. With this information, William searches the library again for evidence. The abbot is annoyed by William's unsuccessful investigation and the interference of the Inquisition and dismisses him. Nevertheless, William and Adso break into the library again during the night and reach the hidden room "finis Africae" by accidentally solving an etymological riddle.
In the hidden room of the library, William and Adso meet Jorge, who has been waiting for them. He admits that he has controlled the abbey for decades and that the abbot is his latest victim, locked up to suffocate. William asks Jorge for the second book of Aristotle's Poetics, which is about the virtues of laughter, and Jorge agrees. William realizes that Jorge has prepared the pages with a herbal poison that he once stole from Severin to prevent the book from being destroyed.
William concludes that Venantius read the book while translating it and died from the poison. Berengar came across the dead man, hid the body and later died himself. Malachi was instigated by Jorge to fetch the book and died after reading it. The murders follow the symbolism of the seven trumpets in Revelation, but Jorge insists that this was part of a divine plan, not the premeditated work of a serial killer.
Jorge eats the poisoned pages of the book and ignites a fire that burns him and the library and spreads to the entire abbey. The monks try in vain to put out the fire. William struggles with his failure and seems to lose his faith in God. Dejected, he and Adso flee the destroyed abbey.
Years later, an aged Adso returns to the ruins and salvages what is left of the books to build a modest library.
