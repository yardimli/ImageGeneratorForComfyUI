Sense and Sensibility
Jane Austen


"Sense and Sensibility" is the first novel published by Jane Austen. It tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose different approaches to life - one characterized by reason, the other by emotionality - form the basis of the novel. Austen's work highlights the challenges and social conventions faced by women of her time, particularly in relation to marriage and financial security.
Summary
After the death of Henry Dashwood, his three daughters Elinor, Marianne and Margaret and their mother are abandoned by their half-brother John, who is from Henry's first marriage. John's wife Fanny easily convinces him that he owes his half-sisters and stepmother nothing, cheating them out of their share of the inheritance. As a result, their financial status drops considerably, putting them in a particularly difficult position.
Determined to leave Sussex and the Norland estate, where her daughter-in-law has moved in as mistress, Mrs. Dashwood travels with her daughters to distant Devon. There, a generous relative, Sir John Middleton, has offered them the chance to live in his country house, Barton Cottage.
Elinor Dashwood, the nineteen-year-old eldest of the Dashwood sisters, is reluctant to leave home as she has to leave behind Edward Ferrars, her brother-in-law, with whom she fell in love shortly after meeting him. However, because Edward's mother wants a financially better-off partner for him, the attractive but almost penniless Elinor does not have high hopes from the outset. As a result, her younger sister Marianne sometimes doubts Elinor's feelings for Edward, as she cannot understand how true love can be held back as easily as Elinor seems to do.
Shortly after her move, Marianne is "rescued" by the handsome Mr. Wil-loughby when she sprains her ankle during a walk and can no longer walk. The open and emotional Marianne quickly falls in love with her charming rescuer, who seems to recognize her feelings. It is therefore not surprising that Marianne takes no liking to the older and more reserved Colonel Brandon, even though he has fallen in love with her.
After Marianne and Willoughby have been getting to know each other and doing things together for some time, Willoughby suddenly leaves for London without explanation. Marianne, who had fully expected a marriage proposal, is deeply unhappy and sinks into self-pity. In this situation, an invitation from Mrs. Jennings, the neighbor, who wants to take Marianne and Elinor to London, comes just in time. Elinor is less than pleased at the prospect, however, as she has since learned that Edward, who is also in London, has been engaged for five years. Out of consideration for her mother and sister, who are already suffering enough from Willoughby's abrupt disappearance, and because she has been told this information in confidence, Elinor has not told anyone. Marianne therefore mistakenly believes that Elinor should be happy about the trip. In the end, Elinor is overruled by her mother and sister, and all three travel to London with Mrs. Jennings.
Marianne and Willoughby meet again at a ball in London, but he has not replied to any of her affectionate letters. Contrary to Marianne's hopes, he is distant and cool towards her. Marianne is deeply hurt when she learns shortly afterwards that he has become engaged to a wealthy lady. Her grief intensifies as she gives in to her sorrow. During this time, Colonel Brandon visits Elinor and Marianne in London. He wants to help Marianne break away from Willoughby and reveals to Elinor that Willoughby has seduced his ward, the young daughter of his childhood sweetheart Eliza, and left her pregnant. This makes Marianne doubt whether Willoughby had similar plans for her.
At the same time, the sisters' attention is diverted by the news of Edward Ferrars' engagement. Marianne is shocked that Elinor has kept this from her for so long and reproaches herself for being caught up in her own grief while her sister was also suffering from heartbreak. Edward's mother urges him to break off the engagement, as his fiancée is even poorer than Elinor. Edward, however, decides to keep his word and is disinherited by his mother. Colonel Brandon, who has suffered a similar fate himself, wants to help the young couple and offers Edward a vicarage through Elinor, which he accepts after a brief hesitation.
Marianne is now desperate to return to her mother. Unfortunately, she catches a cold on the journey. Her illness, the severity of which Marianne initially ignores, eventually worsens to such an extent that it becomes life-threatening. One night, an agitated and now married Willoughby appears, having learned of Marianne's condition. He wants to find out how she is and apologize for his earlier behavior towards her. He explains that he would have married Marianne if he had not been disinherited by his aunt because of his misbehavior towards the daughter of his childhood sweetheart Eliza. Elinor assures him that she will share his explanations with Marianne, who is now at least certain that Willoughby really did love her.
After all the turmoil and adventures, both sisters are relieved to be back in their quiet home with their mother and sister. However, this silence is soon interrupted by the news of Mr. Ferrars' wedding, which makes Mrs. Dashwood truly aware for the first time that Elinor is also suffering - even if she is less open about her feelings. Elinor is indeed deeply saddened and is initially at a loss when Edward appears unexpectedly at her door shortly afterwards. After further enquiries about "Mrs. Edward Ferrars", it is revealed that Edward's former fiancée has left the disinherited vicar and married his younger brother Robert instead. Edward asks Elinor to marry him the same day, and after their wedding they move to Delaford, near Colonel Brandon. As Mrs. Dashwood now also arranges for Marianne to marry Colonel Brandon, this union is only a matter of time. Marianne marries the infatuated colonel with genuine appreciation, which develops into true love over time.
The sisters are not only happy to have found their love, but also to live close to each other and to have husbands who have become friends.
