Huckleberry Finn
Mark Twain

"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain is a landmark American novel that follows the journey of a runaway boy and an escaped slave down the Mississippi River. Through their series of adventures, the novel offers a powerful satire of society, a profound exploration of friendship and morality, and a timeless story about the search for freedom from the constraints of "sivilization."
Summary
The story begins where "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" left off, with Huckleberry Finn living with the kindly Widow Douglas and her stern sister, Miss Watson, who are attempting to civilize him. One night, Huck sneaks out to join his friend Tom Sawyer, who plays a prank on Miss Watson's slave, Jim, by hanging his hat on a tree limb while he sleeps. Huck, however, has little patience for Tom's elaborate, story-based "lies."
Huck's life is disrupted when he sees his father's footprints in the snow. Fearing his brutal and alcoholic father, Pap, he rushes to give his $6,000 fortune to Judge Thatcher for safekeeping. Soon after, Huck finds Pap in his room. Pap, furious about Huck's education and wanting his money, eventually kidnaps Huck and holds him in a remote cabin. While Huck initially enjoys the freedom from societal rules, Pap's drunken beatings become increasingly violent. After being locked in the cabin for three days, Huck meticulously stages his own murder, making it look as if he were killed by robbers, and escapes by paddling a canoe to Jackson's Island in the middle of the Mississippi River.
On the island, while hiding and watching the townspeople search for his body, Huck discovers a campfire belonging to Jim, who has run away after overhearing that Miss Watson planned to sell him. The two decide to travel together. They find shelter in a cave, discover a raft, and come across a floating house containing a dead man, whom Jim covers to spare Huck the sight. Huck later plays a cruel prank on Jim by placing a dead rattlesnake near his blanket, which results in Jim being bitten by the snake's living mate. Filled with remorse, Huck realizes the stupidity of his actions and vows to stop playing such practical jokes.
Huck and Jim begin their journey down the Mississippi, traveling by night on their raft and hiding during the day. They board a wrecked steamboat where they overhear two criminals planning to murder a third. When their own raft breaks loose, Huck and Jim escape in the criminals' boat, leaving the men to their fate. After recovering their raft, they continue south, aiming for Cairo, Illinois, where they plan to take the Ohio River north to the free states. One foggy night, they are separated. When Huck finds Jim again, he tries to convince him it was all a dream. Jim's deep hurt and disappointment cause Huck to feel ashamed, and he humbles himself by apologizing, a significant step in their relationship.
As they near Cairo, Huck's conscience torments him for helping a slave escape. But when Jim expresses his profound gratitude, calling Huck his only true friend, Huck's loyalty wins out. He protects Jim from slave-catchers by fabricating a story about his family having smallpox on the raft, scaring the men away. After this moral victory, they realize they have drifted past Cairo in the fog. Their bad luck continues when a steamboat collides with their raft, separating them once again.
Huck is taken in by the Grangerfords, a wealthy and kind family locked in a deadly, long-standing feud with the neighboring Shepherdson family. Huck befriends their son, Buck, who is his age, and is fascinated by the morbid art and poetry of their deceased daughter, Emmeline. Huck unwittingly becomes a messenger in a secret romance when he helps the Grangerfords' daughter, Sophia, run off with a Shepherdson. This act reignites the feud, leading to a massacre that kills Colonel Grangerford, Buck, and his brothers. Horrified, Huck is led back to Jim by one of the Grangerford's slaves, and the two escape on their recovered raft.
Back on the river, Huck and Jim's journey is interrupted by two con men fleeing a town. The men, a 70-year-old who claims to be the "late Dauphin of France" (the "king") and a 30-year-old who calls himself the "duke" of Bridgewater, take over the raft. They travel from town to town, cheating people with various schemes. The king poses as a reformed pirate at a religious revival to collect money, while the duke prints a fake handbill describing Jim as a runaway slave, which they can use as a cover to travel with him during the day. In one town, they witness Colonel Sherburn shoot a drunken bully and then single-handedly face down the lynch mob that comes for him. The charlatans' most audacious scam is the "Royal Nonesuch," a fraudulent, brief performance that angers the townspeople, forcing the con men to make a hasty escape.
The king and the duke then learn of the death of a wealthy man named Peter Wilks. They impersonate his two brothers from England—the king as the Reverend Harvey Wilks and the duke as his deaf and dumb brother, William—to steal the inheritance from Wilks's three nieces, Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanna. Huck is disgusted by their cruelty and resolves to thwart them. His plan is complicated by the arrival of the real Wilks brothers. In the ensuing chaos, Huck manages to escape back to the raft, only to be caught by the king and the duke.
Continuing south, the desperate and unsuccessful con men commit their final, most heinous act: they sell Jim as a runaway slave to a farmer named Silas Phelps. Faced with the ultimate moral choice, Huck rejects the societal and religious teachings that condemn his actions and, in a moment of profound loyalty to his friend, decides to steal Jim out of slavery.
Arriving at the Phelps's plantation, Huck is mistaken for Tom Sawyer, who is the nephew of Silas's wife, Aunt Sally. When the real Tom Sawyer arrives, he agrees to help Huck by pretending to be his own brother, Sid. Huck is relieved to see the king and the duke finally get their comeuppance when they are tarred and feathered by angry townspeople.
Instead of a simple rescue, Tom, seeking adventure, devises an absurdly elaborate and cruel escape plan for Jim, based on the romantic novels he has read. The plan involves rope ladders, secret journals, and digging a tunnel into the flimsy shed where Jim is held. Tom even sends anonymous letters to the Phelpses, warning them of the escape to ensure there are obstacles. During the chaotic escape, Tom is shot in the leg. Jim refuses to leave him, insisting they get a doctor, an act of self-sacrifice that leads Huck to conclude Jim is "white inside."
The doctor returns with Tom on a mattress and Jim in chains. At this point, Tom reveals the truth: Miss Watson had died two months earlier and, feeling guilty, had freed Jim in her will. Tom's guardian, Aunt Polly, arrives to confirm the story. Jim is finally a free man and is paid by Tom for his troubles. Jim then tells Huck that he can go home without fear, as the dead man they saw in the floating house was Pap. Unwilling to be adopted and "sivilized" by Aunt Sally, Huck ends his story by declaring his intention to head out for new territories.
