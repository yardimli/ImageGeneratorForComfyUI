The Neverending Story
Michael Ende


"The Neverending Story" by Michael Ende is a central work of children's and young adult literature that also appeals profoundly to adults. The novel tells the story of the boy Bastian Balthasar Bux, who immerses himself in a magical book that not only transports him to the fantastic world of Fantastica, but also takes him on a journey to himself. With this work, Michael Ende has created an impressive plea for the power of the imagination and the importance of personal development.
Summary
Bastian Balthasar Bux, a boy of about ten or eleven, is shy, imaginative and a little chubby. Since the death of his mother, which his father has never got over and has taken refuge in his work, Bastian has hardly been noticed at home. He feels like an outsider at school and is often bullied by his classmates. One day he escapes his tormentors by taking refuge in the second-hand bookshop of bookseller Carl Conrad Coreander. There, Bastian discovers the book "The Neverending Story", which Coreander is reading and which immediately fascinates Bastian. It seems to be the perfect book for him, as he has always wanted an endless story. When Coreander leaves the room because of a phone call, Bastian takes the opportunity to steal the book and retreat to the attic of his school, where he begins to read.
The story in the book revolves around Fantastica, the realm of fantasy. The ruler there, the Childlike Empress, is suffering from a serious illness. As her illness progresses, Fantastica is also on the brink of destruction. The land and all its inhabitants are gradually being devoured by the "Nothing", a formless being, so that ultimately nothing remains of them. To save her realm, the Childlike Empress sends young Atreyu, a green-skinned boy Bastian's age, to find a cure. Atreyu travels to various places in Fantastica and learns that the Empress can only be saved if she is given a new name, which only a human child can give her. On his journey, he is joined by Falkor, the lucky dragon, who becomes a loyal companion.
As Bastian follows Atreyu's adventures with excitement, he feels increasingly connected to Fantastica. His cry of terror even reaches Fantastica, and Atreyu sees him briefly in a magic mirror. When Bastian finally realizes that only he can save Fantastica, he fears that the Childlike Empress might deem him unworthy. For this reason, he hesitates to speak the name he has long known. In a desperate attempt to save her almost completely destroyed realm, the Childlike Empress forces him to read the Neverending Story endlessly. Finally, Bastian gives the name she desperately needs: Moon Child.
Bastian himself is then taken to Fantastica. The Childlike Empress presents him with the amulet Auryn and instructs him to recreate Fantastica according to his ideas. When Bastian complies with this request, Fantastica begins to regenerate and Auryn fulfills all his wishes. However, the Childlike Empress has withheld a crucial piece of information from Bastian: Each of his wishes robs him of a memory of the real world and his past. Without this knowledge, Bastian begins to shed his past weaknesses by wishing to be beautiful, strong, brave and wise.
Bastian uses his wishes to create the night forest Perelin and the colorful desert Goab, which are ruled by the lion Grograman. In the silver city of Amarganth, he meets Atreyu and Fuchur again, who want to help him return to the human world. But Bastian is comfortable in his role as the mighty savior of Fantastica and has no desire to return. He enjoys his new power and meets the devious witch Xayide, who further fuels his desire for power. Under her influence, Bastian decides to end his friendship with Atreyu and Falkor, especially after overhearing Atreyu plotting to take the Auryn from him by force.
Determined to be crowned Emperor of Fantastica instead of the Childlike Empress, Bastian presses ahead with his plans. However, the planned coronation ceremony is abruptly interrupted by a declaration of war from Atreyu. A fierce battle breaks out around the Ivory Tower, which ends with Bastian seriously injuring Atreyu.
After the battle, Bastian finds himself in "The City of Old Emperors", a place where people who once came to Fantastica and were unable to find their way back to the human world lead a meaningless existence. There, Bastian realizes that each of his wishes costs him a memory of his own world. He only has as many wishes at his disposal as he still has memories. Now he must learn to recognize his true will through the use of his desires, as only this can lead him back home.
Driven by his desire for companionship, Bastian crosses the fog sea, and his need for security leads him to Dame Eyola in the House of Change. Finally, his desire to love awakens. Bastian discards Auryn and reaches the innermost place of Fantastica, a domed hall where a fountain flows with the water of life, guarded by two snakes. With Atreyu's help, the snakes grant him access to this water, which fills Bastian with joie de vivre and gives him back his original form, in which he now feels comfortable because he has accepted his true self.
With the desire to bring his father the water of life, Bastian returns to the human world, where only a few hours have passed. He returns to his father and shares his experiences with him. This story touches the father deeply and a new, loving relationship develops between father and son.
