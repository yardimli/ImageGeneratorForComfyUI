Summary
Books 1-4: After the ten-year Trojan War, Odysseus, King of Ithaca, has still not returned because he has angered the sea god Poseidon. His son Telemachus lives on Ithaca with his mother Penelope, who is surrounded by importunate suitors. The goddess Athena appeals to Zeus to enable Odysseus to return home and then visits Telemachus to encourage him to seek out his father.
With Athena's support, Telemachus organizes a ship and crew and calls a meeting to address the problem of the suitors. Together they travel to the Greek mainland, where they visit Nestor, the wisest of the Greek warriors. Telemachus then visits Sparta, where he meets Menelaus and Helen, who have since reconciled. Menelaus reveals that Odysseus is being held captive by the nymph Calypso.
Telemachus also learns of the tragic fate of Agamemnon, who was murdered on his return home. Meanwhile, the suitors realize that Telemachus has left the island and make plans to kill him on his return. Penelope is informed of this conspiracy and is deeply concerned for her son's safety.
Books 5-8: Odysseus spends seven years in captivity on the island of Ogygia with the nymph Calypso, who falls in love with him. Despite her offers to make him immortal, Odysseus refuses. At Athena's insistence, Zeus sends Hermes, the messenger of the gods, to Calypso to instruct her to release Odysseus. Odysseus sets off on a raft provided by Calypso, but Poseidon destroys the raft. Through the veil of the sea nymph Ino, he finally manages to reach the island of the Phaeacians, Scheria.
The next morning he meets Nausikaa, who was instructed by Athena in a dream to go to the sea. She advises Odysseus to ask her parents Arete and Alcinous for help. Without knowing his true identity, Alcinous offers him hospitality and a ship for the journey home. During his stay, Odysseus listens to the blind singer Demodocus, who sings about the Trojan Horse - a stratagem in which Odysseus played a key role. Overwhelmed by his emotions, Odysseus finally reveals his identity and begins to tell of his adventures since the fall of Troy.
Books 9-12: Odysseus tells the Phaeacians about his adventures. After an unsuccessful attack on the Cicones, he and his twelve ships are blown off course by storms. They then encounter the lotus eaters, whose fruit causes his men to forget to return home. Odysseus has to bring them back to the ship by force.
They then land on a fertile, uninhabited island near the land of the Cyclops. They explore the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus and find supplies of cheese and meat there. When Polyphemus returns, he blocks the entrance to the cave with a huge rock and devours some of Odysseus' men. Odysseus pretends to be "Nobody" and gets Polyphemus drunk before blinding him with a red-hot wooden stake. When Polyphemus calls for help and explains that "Nobody" has attacked him, his neighbors ignore his cries. Odysseus and his men seize the opportunity and escape by hiding among the sheep being driven out of the cave.
Books 9-12: During their escape, Odysseus mocks Polyphemus and finally reveals his true identity. The enraged Cyclops then asks his father Poseidon to let Odysseus go astray for ten years. After their escape, Odysseus is given a leather sack by Aeolus that contains all winds except the west wind to ensure a safe return. When Ithaca is in sight, his impatient men open the sack in the hope of finding gold, causing the winds to escape and the ships to be driven back. Aeolus refuses further help, realizing that Odysseus has incurred the wrath of the gods.
After the cannibalistic Laestrygonians destroy all his ships except his own, Odysseus lands on the island of Aeaea, home of the witch goddess Kirke. She turns half of his men into pigs with enchanted cheese and wine. Hermes appears and gives Odysseus the herb Moly, which protects him against Kirke's spell. Odysseus then forces Kirke to turn his men back into men and is later seduced by her. They spend a year with her. On Kirke's advice, they sail to the western edge of the world, where Odysseus makes sacrifices to the dead. He summons the spirit of the prophet Teiresias, who tells him that he may return to Ithaca if he and his men do not eat the sacred cattle of Helios on Thrinacia. Otherwise, the ship and crew are in danger of being lost. Odysseus also meets his deceased mother Anticleia, who informs him about the suitors and the events in Ithaca during his absence. He also speaks with the spirits of his deceased companions from Troy.
On their return to Aeaea, they bury their companion Elpenor and once again seek advice from Kirke on the forthcoming stages of their journey. They sail around the land of the Sirens, with all the sailors except Odysseus covering their ears with beeswax. In order to be able to hear the sirens' song, Odysseus has himself tied to the mast and instructs his men not to untie him under any circumstances, as otherwise he might succumb to their song and fall to his doom. They then navigate the dangerous waters between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, with Scylla devouring six of his men.
Later, they reach the island of Thrinacia. Although Odysseus does not want to dock there, a storm unleashed by Zeus forces them to remain on the island and they consume all the supplies provided by Kirke. While Odysseus prays, his men ignore the warnings of Teiresias and Kirke and slaughter the sacred cattle of Helios. Out of anger, Helios demands that Zeus punish the men. As a result, they are shipwrecked and all but Odysseus, who clings to a fig tree, perish. Finally, Odysseus washes up on the island of Ogygia, where he remains for some time as the lover of the nymph Calypso.
Books 13-20: After the Phaeacians have heard Odysseus' story, they promise him treasures greater than his booty from Troy. They take him asleep to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. When he wakes up, Odysseus is initially confused and thinks he is far away, until Athena reveals to him that he is actually on Ithaca. She hides his treasure and disguises him as an old beggar so that he can explore his own house without being recognized. There he meets Eumaeus, one of his slaves, who treats him kindly. Odysseus tells the workers a made-up story about himself.
Telemachus returns from Sparta and narrowly escapes a trap set by the suitors. He meets Odysseus and together they devise a plan to kill the suitors. Telemachus goes home first, and Odysseus follows him later with Eumaeus, still disguised as a beggar. The suitors mock him, especially Antinous. Odysseus tests Penelope by claiming that he has met Odysseus in Crete and heard news of his recent travels in Thesprotia.
Eurycleia, the housekeeper, recognizes Odysseus by an old scar he bears. She tries to reveal the beggar's true identity to Penelope, but Athena intervenes and prevents Penelope from finding out. Odysseus asks Eurycleia for discretion in order to maintain his disguise.
Books 21-24: The following day, Penelope persuades the suitors to fight for her hand by proposing a competition: they are to draw Odysseus' bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads. Odysseus, still disguised as a beggar, takes part and wins because he is the only one who can draw the bow and shoot the arrow through all the axe heads. He then reveals his true identity and kills Antinous and the other suitors. Telemachus hangs twelve maids whom Eurycleia has accused of disloyalty to Penelope.
Odysseus reveals himself to Penelope, who finally recognizes him when he mentions the bed he has built, which is based on a rooted olive tree. They embrace and make love.
The next day, Odysseus visits his father Laertes and reveals himself to him too. A group of Ithacans, led by Antinous' father Eupeithes, seek revenge for the killed suitors. Before the conflict can escalate, Athena and Zeus intervene and end the hostilities, restoring peace to Ithaca.
