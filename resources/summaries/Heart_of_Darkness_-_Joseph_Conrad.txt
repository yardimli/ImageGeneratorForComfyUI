Heart of Darkness
Joseph Conrad

"Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad is a profound and unsettling novella that chronicles an Englishman's journey into the Belgian Congo, where he confronts the brutal realities of colonialism and the terrifying depths of the human soul. The story is a symbolic exploration of the darkness that lies not only in the unexplored territories of the world but also within the heart of so-called civilized man.
Summary
The story begins on the deck of the Nellie, a cruising yawl anchored in the Thames River, where a group of former sailors are waiting for the tide to change. One of them, Charlie Marlow, begins to narrate a story from his past. He reflects that London was once one of the "dark places of the earth" for its Roman conquerors, suggesting that the line between civilization and savagery is thin. This thought prompts him to recount his experience as a steamboat captain for a Belgian trading company in the Congo.
Driven by a childhood fascination with Africa, Marlow secures a position and travels down the African coast on a French steamer. Upon arriving at the Company's Outer Station, he is horrified by the scene of brutal exploitation. He witnesses a group of mistreated African laborers bound in chains and another group of natives left to die of overwork and starvation under a tree. Amid this "black shadows of disease and starvation," he meets the Company’s impeccably dressed chief accountant, whose neat appearance is a stark contrast to the surrounding decay. It is here that Marlow first hears of Mr. Kurtz, a remarkable agent in charge of an important inner trading post who sends back more ivory than all the other agents combined.
Marlow travels 200 miles overland to the Central Station, a journey that takes fifteen days. There, he discovers that his steamboat has been sunk, a mishap that will delay his journey to Kurtz by months. During this time, he observes the station manager and his cronies, whom he calls "pilgrims." He realizes they are greedy, hollow men who are deeply suspicious and envious of Kurtz's success and his supposed moral ideals. Overhearing a conversation between the manager and his uncle, Marlow learns they hope Kurtz will die in the interior so they can seize his position. This conspiracy makes Marlow feel a strange loyalty to the absent Kurtz.
Once the steamboat is repaired, Marlow begins the long, slow journey up the Congo River, accompanied by a few pilgrims and a crew of some twenty cannibals. The trip feels like a voyage back in time, into a primeval world. The travelers are unnerved by the sight of natives on the shore who howl and dance, an uproar that Marlow feels a strange, primitive connection to, though he resists it by focusing on his work. About fifty miles from Kurtz's station, they find a deserted hut with a stack of firewood and a note warning them to approach with caution.
As they near the Inner Station, a dense fog envelops the boat, and they are surrounded by the eerie cries of natives. When the fog lifts, a sudden attack of arrows rains down on them from the riverbanks, killing Marlow's native helmsman. Marlow sounds the ship's steam whistle, and the terrifying noise frightens the attackers away.
Upon arriving at the Inner Station, Marlow is greeted by a young, eccentric Russian man dressed in patchwork clothes. This man, a devoted follower of Kurtz, reveals that he left the note and that the natives attacked because they don't want Kurtz to be taken away. Marlow soon learns the horrifying truth: Kurtz himself ordered the attack on the steamboat. Looking through his binoculars, Marlow makes another grim discovery: the "round carved balls" on the fence posts surrounding Kurtz's house are actually the shrunken heads of native "rebels."
The Russian explains Kurtz's descent into madness. Kurtz has used his powerful charisma to set himself up as a god to the local tribes, conducting "unspeakable rites" and raiding the country for ivory with extreme brutality. As the pilgrims bring the gravely ill Kurtz out on a stretcher, a magnificent and fierce native woman, apparently Kurtz's mistress, appears on the shore, staring at the departing boat. That night, Kurtz escapes the steamboat and tries to crawl back to the native camp, but Marlow follows and persuades him to return.
On the journey back down the river, the dying Kurtz entrusts his papers to Marlow, including a pamphlet he wrote for the "International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs." The eloquent report on civilizing the natives ends with a chilling, handwritten scrawl: "Exterminate all the brutes!" As his life fades, Kurtz, confronting the abyss of his own soul, utters his final, haunting words: "The horror! The horror!"
Marlow returns to Europe, disgusted by the pretentious and ignorant society he finds there, which seems oblivious to the darkness he has witnessed. In the novel's final scene, he visits Kurtz's fiancée, the Intended. She lives in an idealized world, remembering Kurtz as a great humanitarian. Though Marlow hates lies, he cannot bring himself to shatter her illusions with the terrible truth. When she asks what Kurtz's last words were, Marlow lies and tells her, "The last word he pronounced was—your name."
As Marlow finishes his tale on the Nellie, the unnamed narrator looks out at the Thames, observing that the river seems to lead not into the heart of a great city, but "into the heart of an immense darkness."
