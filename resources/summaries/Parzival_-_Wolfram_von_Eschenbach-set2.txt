Parzival
Wolfram von Eschenbach


"Parzival" by Wolfram von Eschenbach is a fascinating medieval epic and one of the most important works of Middle High German literature, which takes the reader on a journey in search of identity, knighthood and spiritual fulfillment. The epic poem tells the story of the young Parzival, who sets out to become a knight and solve the riddle of the Holy Grail. It consists of 25,000 verses rhymed in pairs and divided into 16 books. Through numerous adventures and personal mistakes, Parzival develops from a naive youth into a mature and wise Grail King. The story is inspired by Chr√©tien de Troyes' unfinished work "Perceval, le Conte du Graal" and also contains influences from other medieval sources.
Summary
The first book begins with the death of King Gandin, Parzival's grandfather. His eldest son Galoes is granted the kingdom, while his brother Gahmuret is offered the land of Anjou as a fief. However, Gahmuret leaves to seek fame. He journeys to the African kingdom of Zazamanc, where the capital is under siege by two armies. Gahmuret offers his support to the besieged city, and Queen Belacane accepts his offer. After beating back the attackers, he marries Queen Belacane and is crowned King of Zazamanc and Azagouc. However, he is soon overcome by the restlessness of peace and secretly flees on a ship, leaving his pregnant wife behind. Belacane later gives birth to their son Feirefiz, whose skin is mottled black and white.
In the second book, Gahmuret returns to the West and marries Queen Herzeloyde. However, his restlessness drives him far away again to fight for the Baruch in the Far East, where he is later killed by a treacherous acquaintance.
The third book tells how the pregnant Herzeloyde, grieving over the death of her husband, retreats to a remote forest hut and swears to protect her unborn child, Parzival, from knighthood at all costs. She raises him in complete ignorance of chivalry and the outside world. This seclusion ends when three knights arrive and tell him about King Arthur's court in Camelot. Parzival decides to go to King Arthur's court. His mother is deeply saddened by his decision, but lets him go and dresses him in fool's garments in the hope that the knights will not take him in as a result. Shortly after his departure, she dies, overwhelmed by despair.
The first part of Parzival's journey takes place entirely in the world of King Arthur, where his colorful and unusual appearance arouses the interest of the court. After becoming embroiled in the court intrigues between Duke Orilus and his wife Jeschute, Parzival meets his cousin Sigune, who reveals his true name to him. Parzival also fights Ither, the red knight of Kukumerlant, whom he eventually kills. Wearing the armor of the red knight, he leaves the court and meets Gurnemanz, who instructs him in the duties of a knight, particularly in self-control and moderation. Gurnemanz also advises him to avoid impertinent curiosity.
In the fourth book, Parzival meets Queen Condwiramurs, with whom he falls in love. She has inherited her father's kingdom, but has lost a large part of it to a hostile king who is besieging her city. Parzival uses his newly acquired knightly skills to reclaim her land. The two marry, but shortly afterwards Parzival sets off again, this time in search of his mother.
In Book V, he arrives at the Grail Castle. However, he asks his host Anfortas neither about his mysterious wound nor about the magical objects displayed before him, as he remembers Gurnemanz's advice not to be too curious. The next morning he wakes up in a completely deserted castle, which leads him to the conclusion that the events of the night may have been an illusion created by evil spirits to deceive him.
Parzival returns to the world of King Arthur and meets Sigune again, who accuses him of not having asked the lord of the castle Anfortas a crucial question ("Oheim, why are you suffering?"), to which Parzival does not reply. She then swears never to speak to him again. Parzival also meets Jeschute again, whom he had unwittingly humiliated at their last meeting. He defeats Orilus in battle and ensures that the marriage between Jeschute and Orilus is renewed.
In Book VI, Parzival returns to King Arthur as an ideal member of the Round Table. But during a feast, Cundrie, the messenger of the Grail, appears and curses Parzival in the name of the Grail. She claims that Parzival has lost his honor because he did not ask the crucial question. Parzival immediately leaves the court as a result, although he is not aware of any guilt.
In Books VII to VIII, Gawan takes on the central role as he attempts to clear his name of a false accusation of murder.
In the ninth book, it is revealed that Parzival suffers from his alienation from God despite his commitment to goodness. After almost five years of wandering and fighting, he acquires a new horse in battle, which belongs to a knight of the Grail. On Good Friday, this horse leads him to Trevrizent, a holy man, to whom Parzival introduces himself as a repentant sinner. He stays with Trevrizent for two weeks, learns the hidden meaning of life and the true significance of the Grail and discovers that his mother is the sister of the Grail King. This encounter marks a step towards a life of spiritual knowledge. Through his loneliness and his longing for the Grail and for Condwiramurs, Parzival increasingly distances himself from the world of King Arthur and is called into the world of the Grail.
Books X to XIV focus on Gawan's efforts to win the hand of the maiden Orgeluse.
In book XV, Parzival fights a knight who initially appears to be more skillful. Parzival's sword breaks in battle, but instead of killing him, the other knight realizes that there is no glory in killing a defenseless opponent. When they discover that they have the same father, the battle ends. Cundrie reappears and announces that Parzival's name has appeared on the Grail and that he is destined to be the new Grail King. Parzival then rides to the Grail Castle with Feirefiz and asks Anfortas the decisive question, which heals him and makes Parzival King of the Grail.
In Book XVI, Parzival returns to his wife and children and returns to the Grail Castle with his wife and Loherangrin. Although Feirefiz cannot see the Grail, he catches sight of the Grail maiden, Anfortas' sister, and immediately falls in love with her. In order to get her, he has himself baptized and is then able to see the Grail.
