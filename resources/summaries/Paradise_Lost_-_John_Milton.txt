Paradise Lost
John Milton

"Paradise Lost" by John Milton is a monumental epic poem that recounts the biblical story of the Fall of Man. The narrative centers on the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their subsequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Milton's work is not merely a retelling of Genesis, but a profound exploration of cosmic conflict, free will, divine justice, and mercy, spanning the realms of Heaven, Hell, and the newly created Earth. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest works in the English language.
Summary
The poem opens in Hell, where Satan and his legions of rebellious angels find themselves after being defeated in a war against God the Father. Vowing eternal war, Satan rallies his followers. They construct a magnificent palace, Pandemonium, and hold a council to decide their next move. While the devils Moloch, Belial, and Mammon propose various strategies, it is Satan's second-in-command, Beelzebub, who suggests an indirect attack on God by seducing His newest creation, humankind. The plan is unanimously approved, but none but Satan himself dares to undertake the perilous journey through the abyss of Chaos. At the gates of Hell, Satan encounters the monstrous figures of Sin and Death. Sin reveals that she sprang from Satan's head during his rebellion and that Death is their incestuous son. After being raped by her own son, she gave birth to the hounds of Hell that now torment her. Persuading them to open the gates, Satan ventures into the realm of Chaos, where he convinces its rulers, Chaos and Old Night, to direct him toward the new world God has created.
In Heaven, God the Father, who is all-knowing, sees Satan's escape and predicts that he will succeed in causing humanity's fall. While denouncing human disobedience, God affirms that His mercy will prevail. A divine dilemma arises: justice demands a death penalty for sin, but a substitute can be found. God the Son resolves this by offering himself as a future sacrifice for mankind. Meanwhile, Satan reaches the outer shell of the new world, passing through a Limbo reserved for fools, and makes his way to the Sun. Disguised as a cherub, he deceives the Sun's regent, Uriel, and is directed to Earth. In a soliloquy, Satan laments his own evil but hardens his resolve for revenge. He leaps over the walls of Paradise and, taking the form of various animals, spies on Adam and Eve, learning of God's single prohibition: not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Filled with envy, Satan whispers a tempting dream into the sleeping Eve's mind. He is discovered by the guardian angels and confronted by their leader, Gabriel. A battle nearly ensues, but is halted by the appearance of God's golden scales in the sky, a sign of divine justice.
Eve awakens and tells Adam of her dream, in which an angel persuaded her to eat the forbidden fruit. Adam reassures her that she is not guilty of a sin committed in a dream. To properly warn the human pair, God the Father sends the angel Raphael to instruct them about the danger they face. Raphael recounts the origin of evil, explaining that Satan, envious of the Son's exalted position, led a third of the angels in a rebellion against God. Despite a warning from the loyal angel Abdiel, the war in Heaven began. After two days of fighting with inconclusive results, God the Son, riding in the Father's chariot, single-handedly routed the rebel army, causing them to cast themselves from Heaven's walls down into the newly-prepared Hell. Raphael concludes his tale by warning Adam and Eve not to follow Satan's example of disobedience.
At Adam's request, Raphael continues his instruction, describing how the Son created the world out of the formless matter of Chaos in six days, with humankind as the pinnacle of creation, made in God's image. Adam, curious about the cosmos, asks about the stars and planets, but Raphael advises him that such knowledge is not necessary for him. Adam then recounts his own first memories: awakening into existence, naming the animals, and feeling a loneliness that led him to ask God for a companion. He describes the creation of Eve from his rib and the powerful, overwhelming love he feels for her. Adam admits that these emotions are so strong he fears he cannot control them, prompting Raphael to lecture him on the difference between animal passion and true human love. With a final warning to resist temptation, Raphael departs.
Eve suggests that she and Adam work in separate parts of the garden to be more productive. Adam is hesitant, fearing the danger of being alone, but after a debate, he reluctantly agrees. Satan, having entered the body of a serpent, finds Eve alone and leads her to the forbidden tree. Flattering her and arguing that the fruit will bring wisdom and godliness, he persuades her to disobey God's command. Eve eats the fruit and then returns to Adam, convincing him of what she has done. Horrified at the thought of losing her, Adam decides he would rather fall with her than live without her, and he too eats the fruit. They are overcome with lust and, after making love, fall into a troubled sleep. They awaken filled with guilt and shame, covering their nakedness and bitterly blaming each other for their transgression. The Son of God descends to Paradise to pass judgment, cursing the serpent and sentencing Adam and Eve to sorrow, labor, and eventual death. Meanwhile, Sin and Death, sensing Satan's success, build a broad bridge from Hell to Earth. Satan returns to Pandemonium to boast of his triumph, but he and his followers are suddenly transformed into hissing serpents, tormented by an unquenchable thirst and forced to chew on ashen, illusory fruit. In Paradise, Adam despairs, but when Eve proposes suicide, she also offers to take all the blame upon herself. Moved by her humility, Adam suggests they instead pray to God for forgiveness and help.
The Father hears their prayers but declares they must be banished from Paradise. The archangel Michael is sent to enforce the decree. He leads a grieving Adam to the highest hill in Paradise and shows him a vision of the future of mankind. Adam witnesses the first murder as Cain kills Abel, sees the ravages of disease, the hubris of the Tower of Babel, and the destruction of the world by a great flood, survived only by Noah and his family. The vision continues with the history of Israel, from Abraham to the eventual birth of the Messiah. Michael explains that the Son's sacrifice will redeem humanity and that a long struggle between good and evil will ensue until the end of time, when a new Heaven and Earth will be created for the faithful. Michael has instilled a similar vision in Eve's mind as she slept. Reassured by the promise of a future redeemer, Adam and Eve, hand in hand, are led out of Paradise by Michael to begin their journey into the world.
