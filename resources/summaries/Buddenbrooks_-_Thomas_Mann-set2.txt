Buddenbrooks
Thomas Mann


"Buddenbrooks" by Thomas Mann is an epochal work of realist literature that captivates the reader with its impressive depiction of the rise and fall of a wealthy merchant family. The novel, which Mann completed at the age of just 25 and which later won him the Nobel Prize for Literature, tells the story of the Buddenbrooks over several generations and offers a profound insight into the social, cultural and moral changes of the 19th century.
Summary
In 1835, the Buddenbrooks, a respected and wealthy family of grain merchants, host a dinner party at their newly acquired home in Lübeck. The family consists of Johann Buddenbrook Jr, the head of the family, his wife Antoinette, their son Johann III, called "Jean", his wife Elizabeth and their three school-age children, sons Thomas and Christian, and daughter Antonie, called "Tony". The servants include several people, including Ida Jungmann, who serves as a nanny. In the middle of the evening, a letter arrives from Gotthold, Johann's estranged son and Jean's half-brother. Gotthold's lifestyle is condemned by the elder Johann and the letter is ignored. Johann III and Elisabeth later add a daughter, Klara, to the family.
Over time, the individual character traits of the growing children become clear. Thomas shows himself to be ambitious and enterprising, while Christian is interested in amusements and leisure activities. Tony, on the other hand, is proud and rejects the advances of Herman Hagenström, the scion of an up-and-coming family. Herman is unimpressed, but Tony resents him for the rest of his life. After the death of the elder Johann and Antoinette, the younger Johann takes over the family business and gives Gotthold his share of the inheritance. However, there is never any rapprochement between the half-brothers, and Gotthold's unmarried daughters harbor a lasting grudge against Johann's family and later enjoy their misadventures. Thomas goes to Amsterdam to study, and Tony attends boarding school, where she forms a lifelong friendship with her teacher Therese "Sesemi" Weichbrodt.
Bendix Grünlich, a smooth businessman from Hamburg, introduces himself to the Buddenbrook family. Tony is averse to him from the start. To get away from him, she spends a vacation in Travemünde, a seaside resort northeast of Lübeck. There she meets Morten Schwarzkopf, a medical student, and develops romantic feelings for him. Nevertheless, she gives in to family pressure and marries Grünlich in 1846, despite her reservations. The couple have a daughter, Erika. It later emerges that Grünlich had manipulated his books to conceal debts and had only married Tony in the hope that Johann would provide him with financial help. Johann refuses, takes Tony and Erika back, and Grünlich goes bankrupt. In 1850, Tony divorces him.
Meanwhile, Christian undertakes a long journey to Valparaíso in Chile. At the same time, Thomas returns and joins the family business. In the course of the riots of 1848, Johann is able to calm a furious mob with a speech. He and Elisabeth became increasingly religious in their later years. Johann dies in 1855, whereupon Thomas takes over the business. Christian returns, works briefly for his brother, but has no talent or interest in the trade. He attracts attention due to strange illnesses and bizarre behavior, which is why Thomas sends him away to protect the family's reputation. Thomas later marries Gerda Arnoldsen, a talented violinist and Tony's former classmate.
Klara, the younger sister, marries Sievert Tiburtius, a pastor from Riga, but dies childless of tuberculosis. Tony marries Alois Permaneder, a simple but decent hop merchant from Munich. She feels unhappy and alienated in Munich. After the birth of a child, who dies on the same day, her life becomes even bleaker. When she catches Permaneder drunk and harassing the maid, she leaves him and returns to Lübeck. Permaneder surprises her by apologizing, waiving his dowry in a letter and agreeing to a divorce.
In the 1860s, Thomas becomes a father and rises to the position of senator. He builds a magnificent villa, but soon regrets this decision, as maintaining the new house takes up a lot of time and money. The old family home falls into disrepair and Thomas suffers several setbacks and losses in his business. Although his tireless work keeps the business alive, it is visibly wearing on him. During a celebration of the company's centenary in 1868, he learns of another financial loss.
Erika, who is now an adult, marries Hugo Weinschenk, the manager of a fire insurance company, and gives birth to a daughter, Elisabeth. Weinschenk is later arrested for insurance fraud and sent to prison. Thomas' son, Johann IV, known as "Hanno", is born a weak and sickly child. As he grows up, he remains reserved, melancholy and is often teased by other children. His only friend is Kai Mölln, an unkempt young count. Johann turns out to be a bad pupil, but discovers his talent for music. Despite his friendship with Uncle Christian, Thomas is disappointed in his son.
In 1871, the older Elisabeth dies of pneumonia. Tony, Erika and little Elisabeth leave the old house, which is sold disappointingly cheaply to the successful businessman Herman Hagenström. Christian reveals his desire to marry Aline, a woman with a shady reputation who has three illegitimate children. As one of them could be Christian's, Thomas forbids him to marry for inheritance reasons. He sends Johann to Travemünde to improve his health. Although Johann enjoys the peace and quiet there, he does not return refreshed. Weinschenk is dismissed and, broken and disgraced, he permanently leaves his family and Germany.
Thomas is increasingly overwhelmed by the challenges of running his faltering business and falls increasingly into depression and exhaustion. He becomes obsessed with his appearance and suspects that his wife may be unfaithful. In 1874, he spends a vacation in Travemünde with Christian and old friends, where they ponder various topics such as life, religion, business and German unification. In 1875, after a visit to the dentist, he suffers a breakdown and dies. His deep despair and his distrust of his only heir, his son, are expressed in his will, in which he orders the liquidation of his company. The entire estate is sold off, including the villa, and the long-time servant Ida loses her job.
Christian takes over his share of his father's inheritance and marries Aline, but his illnesses and strange behavior lead to him being committed to an asylum, while Aline manages his fortune. Johann continues to suffer at school, only manages to get through his lessons by cheating and remains in poor health. There are indications that he may be homosexual. With the exception of his friend Kai, he is generally despised. In 1877, he falls ill with typhoid fever and dies shortly afterwards. His mother Gerda returns to Amsterdam, and the only survivors of the once large Buddenbrook family are the embittered Tony, her daughter Erika and granddaughter Elisabeth. They only find friendship and support in the elderly and increasingly frail Therese Weichbrodt. In their despair, they cling to the faint hope that they might be reunited with their family in the afterlife.
