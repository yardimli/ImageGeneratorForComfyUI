The Grapes of Wrath
John Steinbeck


"The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck is one of the most important works of American literature and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. This epic novel tells the story of the Joad family, who are displaced from their home farm in Oklahoma during the Great Depression and move to California in the hope of a better life. Steinbeck's passionate portrayal of the lives and struggles of the uprooted working class is a powerful plea for justice and humanity.
Summary
The story begins when Tom Joad is released from prison after serving a sentence for manslaughter in self-defense. On his way home to Sallisaw, Oklahoma, he meets Jim Casy, a former preacher he knows from his childhood. Together they make their way to Tom's parents' house, only to find it deserted. Through Muley Graves, an old neighbor, they learn that the family has found refuge in Uncle John Joad's house, as the banks have confiscated the farms and evicted the farmers.
The following day, Tom and Casy arrive at Uncle John's house and find the family packing their remaining possessions into a converted Hudson limousine truck. The Dust Bowl (devastating droughts and dust storms) has destroyed the crops, the loans are in default, and the farm has been repossessed. The family plans to move to California in hopes of fertile soil and well-paying work. Despite his parole conditions, Tom decides to take the risk and go with his family, and invites Casy to join them.
As they make their way west on Route 66, the Joads discover that they are not the only ones in search of a better life. In makeshift camps, they meet other travelers, some even on their way back from California, who tell them of their disappointments. These stories cast doubt on their plans. On the long and tiring journey, the family suffers losses: the grandfather dies and is buried en route; the grandmother dies shortly before reaching the Californian border; and both Noah, the Joads' eldest son, and Connie Rivers, the husband of the pregnant Rose of Sharon, leave the group. Under the strong and resolute leadership of Ma Joad, the remaining family continues their journey as there is nothing left for them in Oklahoma.
After arriving in California, the Joads soon realize that the labor market situation is anything but rosy. Excessive numbers of workers depress wages and the workers are exploited to the point of exhaustion. Large agribusinesses control the market, which puts smaller farmers under pressure, while the police and other law enforcement agencies collaborate with the growers.
In the first migrant camp, Hooverville, Jim Casy is arrested after assaulting a sheriff's deputy to save the life of a fleeing laborer. The Joads then find refuge in Weedpatch Camp, a camp run by the Resettlement Administration that offers better conditions but cannot provide work or enough food for all those in need. Nevertheless, as a federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from police attacks.
Casy, meanwhile, becomes a union voice and tries to organize the workers. The Joads get a job in a peach orchard, but despite their hard work, their earnings are barely enough to survive. When the pay is then halved, the situation comes to a head. Casy goes on a violent strike and is killed. Tom, who is watching the incident, beats up the murderer in the heat of the moment and has to flee.
The Joads secretly leave the plantation and find work on a cotton farm, but Tom is still in danger of being arrested and possibly even lynched for the murder. The family is forced to resign themselves to an existence on the margins of society and in constant uncertainty, as conditions in California do not fulfill what they were promised.
Realizing that his presence poses a danger to his family and could put them on the blacklist, Tom makes the difficult decision to say goodbye to his family. He vows to dedicate his life to the fight against oppression. The Joads continue their arduous work on the cotton farm, saving every penny to buy food.
A tragic event strikes the family when Rose of Sharon's newborn is stillborn. But Ma Joad shows unwavering strength and drives the family to overcome the pain. However, the problems do not diminish: winter rains flood their home and damage their car, forcing them to move to higher ground.
In the final chapter of the book, the Joads seek refuge from the floods in an abandoned barn. Here they come across a young boy and his dying, starving father. Ma realizes that there is only one way to save the man. She exchanges glances with Rose of Sharon, and an unspoken understanding develops between them. In a profound gesture of compassion, Rose of Sharon lets the man drink her breast milk when she is alone with him.
