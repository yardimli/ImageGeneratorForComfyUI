The Crucible
Arthur Miller
"The Crucible" by Arthur Miller is a gripping historical drama that uses the Salem witch trials of 1692 to explore the devastating effects of mass hysteria, intolerance, and false accusations. The play centers on the chaos that erupts in a Puritan New England town when rumors of witchcraft begin to fly, leading to the destruction of many innocent lives. "The Crucible" serves not only as a portrayal of a dark chapter in American history but also as a powerful allegory for the anti-communist "witch hunts" led by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.

Summary
In the Puritan town of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, the Reverend Parris is thrown into a panic when he finds his daughter, Betty, lying inert in her bed. Rumors of witchcraft are already circulating, and Parris, a ruthless man concerned with his reputation, fears his daughter has been possessed. The previous night, he had discovered Betty, his niece Abigail Williams, their slave Tituba, and other local girls dancing in the forest. He suspects them of devil-worship and has sent for a witchcraft expert, Reverend Hale. Abigail dismisses their activities as harmless fun, explaining that Betty was simply frightened when Parris surprised them. Parris remains unconvinced, especially given that Abigail was dismissed from her job at the Proctor farm seven months earlier after Elizabeth Proctor discovered her affair with her husband, John Proctor. The Putnams, Thomas and Ann, arrive at the Parris home. Ann Putnam is convinced witchcraft is to blame for her daughter Ruth's similar illness and the deaths of her seven infant babies.

Once the adults leave to pray, Abigail threatens the other girls into silence about their activities. John Proctor arrives, and Abigail attempts to rekindle their affair, but he rejects her. Suddenly, Betty wakes and begins to whine loudly, bringing Parris and the Putnams rushing back in, accompanied by the respected Rebecca Nurse and the elderly Giles Corey. Rebecca suggests they rely on God and patience, but Putnam argues the devil is at work. The Reverend Hale arrives and begins his investigation. Unable to wake Betty, he questions Abigail, who deflects the blame onto Tituba. Under pressure and prompting from Parris, Tituba confesses to communicating with the devil and begins naming others she has supposedly seen with him. In a frenzied state, Betty sits up and joins Abigail in echoing Tituba’s accusations, crying out the names of other townspeople.

A week later, John Proctor returns home to a tense atmosphere with his wife, Elizabeth. She wants him to go to the court and expose Abigail's claim that the witchcraft scare is a hoax, but John hesitates, causing Elizabeth to suspect he still has feelings for Abigail. Their servant, Mary Warren, an official in the court, returns and gives Elizabeth a poppet (a doll) she made during the proceedings. Mary reveals that Elizabeth's name was mentioned in court. Elizabeth realizes Abigail wants her dead so she can take her place. Shamed, John resolves to go to court to save his wife. Reverend Hale arrives to test the Christian character of those accused. He questions Proctor’s infrequent church attendance and asks him to recite the Ten Commandments; John remembers all but one—the commandment against adultery. Soon after, Giles Corey and Francis Nurse arrive with the news that their wives, Martha and Rebecca, have been arrested. Hale is troubled but maintains his faith in the court. A court official, Cheever, arrives with a warrant for Elizabeth’s arrest on the charge of attempting to murder Abigail. As proof, he finds a long pin inside the poppet Mary gave to Elizabeth, which corresponds to an incident where Abigail screamed and pulled a pin from her own stomach. Mary confesses the doll is hers, but it is not enough. Proctor, enraged, tears up the warrant, but Elizabeth calms him and is taken away in chains. John realizes he must reveal his adultery with Abigail to save his wife.

Five weeks later in court, John Proctor, accompanied by Mary Warren, Giles Corey, and Francis Nurse, attempts to prove to Judge Danforth and Judge Hathorne that the girls are lying. Giles Corey presents a deposition accusing Thomas Putnam of using the trials to have a neighbor executed so he can buy the man's forfeited land, but he refuses to name his informant, knowing the man will be arrested. When Proctor presents Mary Warren's deposition stating the girls are pretending, Danforth brings the other girls in to confront her. When challenged to fake a faint as she claimed to do in court, Mary is unable. To discredit her, Abigail and the other girls pretend Mary is bewitching them. To stop the hysteria, John Proctor calls Abigail a "whore" and confesses his adultery to expose her motive for wanting Elizabeth dead. To test John’s story, Danforth summons Elizabeth, who is known for her honesty. Unaware that John has confessed, she lies to protect her husband’s reputation, which ironically condemns him. Hale pleads for Proctor, but the girls' hysterical act overwhelms the court. Accusing Proctor of being in league with the devil, Danforth condemns him to death. Proctor cries out against the court's ignorance, and Hale quits the proceedings in disgust.

Three months later, on the morning of Proctor’s execution, Judge Danforth learns that Reverend Parris has allowed Reverend Hale to pray with the condemned. Abigail and Mercy Lewis have fled Salem, taking all of Parris’s money. Despite this, Danforth refuses to pardon anyone, fearing it will make the court appear weak. Hoping a confession from Proctor will validate the court's rulings, they bring in Elizabeth to convince her husband to confess. Hale, having lost all faith in the court, begs her to persuade John to lie to save his life. Alone with John, Elizabeth tells him that Giles Corey was tortured to death with heavy stones for refusing to enter a plea. John, wanting to live, reluctantly agrees to confess. However, when Danforth presses him to name others he saw with the devil, particularly Rebecca Nurse, John refuses. He signs the confession but will not hand it over, horrified at the thought of his lie being made public and his name being ruined. Realizing he cannot live with this lie and tarnish his name for his sons, he tears up the confession, finding redemption in his action. Despite the desperate pleas of Parris and Hale, John Proctor walks calmly to his death.
