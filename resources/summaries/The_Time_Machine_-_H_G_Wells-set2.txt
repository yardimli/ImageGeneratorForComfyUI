The Time Machine
H. G. Wells


"The Time Machine" by H.G. Wells is one of the pioneers of science fiction literature and deals with the concept of time travel, a theme that has since been taken up in numerous literary and cinematic works. This novel tells the story of a nameless scientist, known as the "Time Traveler", who builds a machine that takes him far into the future, where he encounters the Eloi and the Morlocks, two radically different species that have emerged from humanity.
Summary
In the book, the main character, an English scientist and inventor from the Victorian era living in Richmond, Surrey, is referred to only as the "Time Traveler". At weekly dinner parties, he is accompanied by guests who, apart from one (Filby), also remain anonymous and are only described by their profession or physical characteristics.
The story follows a presentation by the time traveler in which he explains to his guests that time can be seen as a fourth dimension. He shows a model of a machine that can travel through this dimension and reveals that he has built a life-size machine that makes this possible in reality. At a dinner the following week, the time traveler returns to share an impressive tale.
In this story, the time traveler describes his test of the machine. At first he believes that nothing has happened, but then discovers that he has traveled five hours into the future. As he continues his journey, he observes how his house disappears and a magnificent garden landscape appears. He lands in the year 802,701 A.D. and meets the Eloi, a race of small, graceful, childlike-looking adults. They live in large, future-oriented buildings, which are falling into disrepair, and feed on fruit. Communicating with them proves difficult as they show little curiosity or discipline. They appear happy and carefree, but are afraid of the dark and especially moonless nights.
After exploring the Eloi dwellings, the time traveler reaches a hill overlooking London. There he discovers that the earth has turned into a vast garden, with no visible traces of human civilization or technology from the past hundreds of thousands of years. He concludes that communism has finally been realized.
When the time traveler returns to his arrival point, he is horrified not to find his time machine. He concludes that it has been taken by strangers to a nearby sphinx-like building with heavy doors that are locked from the inside. Fortunately, he had removed the control levers so that the machine cannot travel in time without them. Later, he is threatened in the darkness by the Morlocks, ape-like creatures that live underground and only come to the surface at night.
The time traveler explores the "wells" that lead to the Morlock shelters and discovers the industry that enables the Eloi to live on the surface. He develops the theory that the humans have split into two species: the degraded aristocracy of the Eloi and their former servants, who have become the brutal Morlocks. He realizes that the Morlocks have stolen his machine and that they are using the Eloi as food. His realization that intelligence arises as a reaction to danger leads him to the conclusion that the Eloi, having had no challenges, have atrophied mentally and physically.
Meanwhile, he rescues an Eloi, Weena, from drowning, and they develop a tender bond. He takes Weena on a journey to a place known as "The Palace of Green Porcelain", which turns out to be a dilapidated museum. There he finds matches and improvises a weapon to fight the Morlocks and get his machine back. He plans to take Weena back to his time, but on the way back they have to spend the night in the forest, where they are overpowered by Morlocks. Weena faints, and the time traveler escapes by starting a fire that spreads into a forest fire. Weena and the Morlocks perish, and the Time Traveler is deeply saddened by the loss of Weena.
The Morlocks, who have hidden the time machine in the sphinx, use it as a trap to catch the time traveler. They have no idea that he will use it to escape instead. After re-engaging the levers, he travels 30 million years into the future and observes the last days of the Earth. He sees menacing, crab-like creatures roaming blood-red beaches and chasing giant butterflies in a world covered in simple lichen. He travels even further and watches the sun expand and redden, and the world freeze in silence as the last degenerate creatures die out.
Shaken, he returns to his own time, just three hours after he originally left, and arrives late at his own dinner party. The time traveler tells his disbelieving guests about his experiences and shows them two strange white flowers that Weena had put in his pocket as proof.
The original narrator then takes over the story again, recounting how he met the time traveler the next day as he prepared for another expedition. The time traveler promised to return soon, but the narrator reveals that he waited three years before writing down the story. The time traveler has not returned since.
