Iliad
Homer


The "Iliad" by the Greek poet Homer is a masterpiece of ancient literature and a cornerstone of Western culture. In 24 books, the epic poem tells the story of the Trojan War, a violent conflict between the Greeks and the Trojans, which has fascinated readers for thousands of years with its mythical heroes and dramatic conflicts. The plot of the "Iliad" concentrates on a period of around 40 days in the last year of the ten-year war and focuses in particular on the figure of Achilles. The epic is not only a war narrative, but also a profound examination of human passions and weaknesses, divine intervention and fate.
Summary
Book 1: The action opens with a quarrel between King Agamemnon and Achilles, the greatest warrior of the Greeks. Agamemnon refuses to return the daughter of one of Apollo's priests, which triggers a plague among the Greeks. To put an end to the plague, he finally returns the girl, but takes Briseis, a prisoner of war and Achilles' lover, as a replacement. Angered, Achilles withdraws and asks his mother, the sea goddess Thetis, to support the Trojans in order to punish the Greeks for the insult they have suffered.
Book 2: Zeus sends King Agamemnon a deceptive dream that promises him victory over Troy. Agamemnon calls his troops together and tests their loyalty, followed by a detailed enumeration of the Greek and Trojan fighters.
Books 3-4: The two armies face each other. A duel between Menelaus and Paris is to decide the war. Menelaus wins, but Aphrodite intervenes and brings Paris safely back to Troy. The gods debate the fate of Troy, and Athena persuades the Trojan Pandarus to shoot an arrow at Menelaus, which reignites the war.
Book 5: The Greek hero Diomedes fights fiercely and is strengthened by Athena, who even allows him to wound the gods Ares and Aphrodite.

In his distress, Hera and Hephaestus come to his aid. Hephaestus uses a devastating firestorm to repel the enraged river god.
Book 22: Despite his parents' objections, Hector decides to confront Achilles at the city gates so as not to show any sign of weakness. As Achilles charges, Hector flees three times around the city walls. The gods debate Hector's fate and Zeus' scales prophesize his death.

Achilles, who ignores Hector's pleas for an honorable burial, attacks and kills Hector with a spear to the neck. With his last breath, Hector prophesies an imminent death to Achilles.

Achilles, deeply moved by the old king's humility and grief, agrees. The "Iliad" ends with the return of Hector's body to Troy and its ceremonial burial, while the Trojan War continues unabated.
