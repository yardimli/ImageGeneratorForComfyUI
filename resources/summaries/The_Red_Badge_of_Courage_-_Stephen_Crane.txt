The Red Badge of Courage
Stephen Crane
"The Red Badge of Courage" by Stephen Crane is a groundbreaking psychological novel that explores the mind of a young soldier, Henry Fleming, as he confronts the brutal realities of the American Civil War for the first time. The novel moves beyond a simple adventure story to provide a profound examination of fear, courage, self-deception, and the chaotic, dehumanizing nature of war. Crane focuses on Henry's internal struggles, his vacillating emotions from vanity and fear to blind rage, ultimately questioning the very nature of heroism and manhood gained in the crucible of battle.
Summary
Henry Fleming, a young farm boy inflamed with visions of military glory, enlists in the Union Army against the wishes of his practical mother. While she disappoints him with her focus on his food and clothing rather than his heroic destiny, he enjoys the feeling of importance before his schoolmates. However, the monotonous reality of camp life soon depresses him. Eager to prove himself, he is also plagued by a private fear: that he will run in the face of battle. He seeks reassurance from his comrades, the quiet and self-confident veteran Jim Conklin, and a loud young man named Wilson who boasts of his future bravery, but Henry feels alone in his secret terror.
Suddenly, the regiment is thrown into battle, and Henry feels swept toward his own slaughter, judging his generals as incompetent. As the enemy charges, a terrified Wilson gives Henry a packet of letters, certain he will die. Henry fires wildly into the enemy ranks, carried along by the group's momentum. He is reassured when the regiment holds its ground and repels the charge, feeling a surge of pride, though he notes his comrades fought like puppets.
He and his comrades begin to celebrate, but the enemy quickly launches a second charge. This time, seeing some soldiers throw down their guns and flee, Henry panics and runs as well. He reaches the rear and watches the artillery gunners, thinking them fools for staying at their posts. When he overhears a general announce that the line held, Henry is filled with shame and hides in the forest, trying to rationalize his flight as a wise act of self-preservation. He watches a squirrel flee from a thrown pine cone and takes comfort in the idea that he merely acted on a law of nature, while his comrades were too stupid to run. His rationalizations are shattered when he stumbles upon a "chapel" in the woods, where he discovers a corpse with a yellow face and ant-crawled eyes, staring blankly. He flees in terror.
Running behind his own lines, he stumbles into a column of wounded men. A tattered soldier sympathetically asks Henry where he is wounded, causing him immense shame. Henry begins to envy the men their injuries, wishing for a "red badge of courage" of his own. He then encounters a badly wounded Jim Conklin, who is writhing in pain. Henry and the tattered soldier help Jim out of the road just before he convulses, grows stiff, and falls dead. The sight fills Henry with rage. The tattered soldier, confused and disoriented, again asks Henry about his wound. Fearing exposure, Henry deserts the man and wanders off, hating himself for his cowardice. He finds himself amid another panicked retreat and, in an attempt to get news, grabs a fellow infantryman, who strikes him on the head with a rifle butt. Dazed and in pain, Henry stumbles back to his own regiment, where his bloody head wound is mistaken for a battle injury, and he is welcomed back as a hero.
The next day, Henry's self-confidence is restored. No one knows he fled, and he feels superior to Wilson, who has transformed from a braggart into a quiet, self-assured soldier and sheepishly asks for his letters back. Believing he has conquered adversity, Henry is ready for the next enemy charge. Filled with a deep hatred for the enemy, he fights like a demon, and his ferocity inspires those around him, who begin to see him as a hero. He then overhears a general dismiss his regiment as "mule drivers." Stung by the insult, Henry is determined to prove him wrong. When ordered to attack, he leads the charge with eyes gleaming. When the flagbearer is shot, Henry and Wilson both grab the flag, but the charge falters and they are forced to retreat. Despite the failure, the regiment redeems itself by repelling a sudden counterattack, and the men feel their honor restored.
Returning to the Union lines, they endure taunts from other soldiers for failing the charge, but Henry swells with pride upon hearing that he and Wilson were praised for their valor. When the regiment is ordered to charge again, Henry carries the flag boldly, fighting in a reckless frenzy until the enemy is driven from the field.
As the gunfire dies down, Henry reflects on his experiences. He feels a pang of guilt for his cowardly retreat the previous day but quickly pushes it aside. He believes he has proven himself in battle, has conquered his fear of death, and will never run again. In his own mind, he has faced war and has finally become a man.
