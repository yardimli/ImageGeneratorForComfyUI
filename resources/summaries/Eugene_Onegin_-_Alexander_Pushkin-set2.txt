Summary
Eugene Onegin is a young dandy from St. Petersburg whose father is ruining himself to maintain his lavish lifestyle. He is an idle, jaded man who feels he has experienced everything. After the death of his father, he leaves everything to his creditors. Having freed himself from his financial worries in St. Petersburg, he takes advantage of his uncle's inheritance and retires to the country. However, the charms of country life only arouse his interest for a few days.
On his uncle's old estate, where he is a heavy drinker, Onegin demonstrates a willingness to reform and replaces the farm labor with taxes, which pleases the peasants but surprises and worries the neighbors. As a result, he flees their society and is regarded as an uncouth and uneducated revolutionary.
Some time later, a new landowner from GÃ¶ttingen, Vladimir Lensky, moves into the area. He is a good match: the young man is attractive and his inheritance seems interesting. He is an idealist, a poet and enthusiastic about German culture. A connoisseur of philosophy, he appreciates Goethe and Schiller. Onegin, who suffers from social isolation, gradually makes friends with his new neighbor.
In their conversations, Lensky confesses to Onegin his passionate and very romantic love for a young neighbor, Olga Larina. However, this girl has an older sister, Tatyana. The older sister, who does not have the sweet charm of her younger sister, is a rather reserved and mysterious girl. She is a passionate lover of sentimental literature, which she devours. This passion is also shared by her mother, who is married to Dmitri Larin, a man for whom she has no great affection: She finds it a substitute for the passionate love she has never experienced. Habit has taken the place of impossible happiness. But the husband - a simple man who is completely indifferent to the literary passions of his wife and daughter and whom his wife has learned to lead by the nose - eventually dies. The chapter ends with Lensky's visit to the cemetery where his parents are buried and to the grave of Dmitri Larin, for whom - as a good poet - he composes a madrigal.
Lensky leads Onegin to the Larins, whose youngest daughter Olga he wants to marry. Tatyana, Olga's older sister, falls in love with Onegin at first sight. She is passionate about her first love and writes him a long, flaming letter that very evening. Hardly calmed down, in the morning she persuades her nurse, with whom she shares all her secrets, to have her grandson deliver the letter to "O.". Eugen, however, refuses on the grounds that he cannot make her happy.
Some time later, Vladimir insists that Eugen attend a ball to celebrate Tatyana's birthday. Bored, Eugen decides to seduce Olga, who agrees to the game, much to Vladimir's despair. Lensky feels betrayed and demands reparation. The pistol duel takes place the next morning at dawn. Onegin shoots Lensky and immediately regrets his senseless death. He then leaves the country where he can no longer stay.
Tatyana is still consumed with love for Onegin. She visits the house he has left and finds his books and other personal belongings there. Finally, her mother decides to take her to Moscow to find her a husband. Tatyana leaves the rural area with regret.
A few years later, Eugen returns from his trip and goes to a reception. There he meets Tatjana again, who has married an old general, and realizes that it was a big mistake to reject her. He becomes sick with love and sends his lover letter after letter without ever receiving a reply. Eugen finally visits Tatjana and catches her crying over his last letter. She tells him that she still loves him, but will remain faithful to her husband.
The novel ends on a melancholy note as Onegin fully realizes the consequences of his actions. It is a final picture of the tragic hero who realizes too late the truth about his feelings and desires.
