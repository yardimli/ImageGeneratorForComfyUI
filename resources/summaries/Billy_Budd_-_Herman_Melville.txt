Summary
In the summer of 1797, during a time of war with France and recent mutinies in the British Navy, the young, handsome, and universally liked sailor Billy Budd is forced to leave the merchant ship The Rights of Man and serve on the warship HMS Indomitable. Billy, known for his cheerful nature and peacemaking abilities, quickly wins over his new shipmates. The only exception is John Claggart, the master-at-arms, who develops an immediate and deep-seated envy and hatred for Billy's innocence and beauty.
Despite Billy's best efforts to perform his duties perfectly, he finds himself the subject of minor, puzzling disciplinary issues. He seeks advice from an old, wise sailor, the Dansker, who cryptically informs him that Claggart is "down on" him. Billy, unable to comprehend such baseless malice, dismisses the warning, especially after Claggart responds to an accidental soup spill with a seemingly playful remark.
Claggart's animosity, which the narrator attributes to a form of "Natural Depravity," intensifies. He arranges for a subordinate to try and entrap Billy in a fabricated mutiny plot. Billy, stuttering with indignation, forcefully rejects the proposal but, in his innocence, fails to report the incident or understand its sinister origins. Convinced of Billy's supposed treachery, Claggart decides to act.
Following a brief skirmish with a French frigate, Claggart approaches the ship's commander, Captain Vere, and formally accuses Billy Budd of plotting a mutiny. Vere, a thoughtful and bookish officer, is shocked and summons both men to his cabin for a private confrontation. When Claggart repeats the false accusation to his face, Billy is overcome with emotion. His lifelong stutter renders him speechless, and in a moment of pure frustration, he strikes Claggart with a single, powerful blow, killing him instantly.
Captain Vere immediately convenes a drumhead court-martial. He acts as both the convening authority and the sole witness. Vere acknowledges Billy's moral innocence and Claggart's likely malice, but he argues that under the Mutiny Act and in the context of wartime, the court has no choice but to condemn Billy for the act of striking and killing a superior officer. Despite the other officers' reluctance, Vere's logic prevails, and Billy is sentenced to be hanged from the yardarm at dawn.
In his final hours, Billy lies in chains, displaying a serene, almost beatific acceptance of his fate. The ship's chaplain, moved by Billy's purity, offers a brief prayer and a kiss before leaving him. At dawn, the entire crew is assembled to witness the execution. Just before he is hanged, Billy's final words ring out clearly, without a stutter: "God bless Captain Vere!" The crew instinctively echoes his cry. Billy dies without the typical physical convulsions, an event that the ship's surgeon cannot scientifically explain. A few days later, Captain Vere is mortally wounded in battle, his last words being "Billy Budd, Billy Budd." The official naval gazette later prints a distorted account of the events, portraying Billy as a villain. However, among sailors, Billy's memory is preserved in a ballad, and the spar from which he was hanged becomes a sacred relic.
