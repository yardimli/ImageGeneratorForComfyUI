Moby Dick
Herman Melville


"Moby Dick" by Herman Melville is a monumental work of American literature that is often regarded as one of the greatest books of all time. The novel recounts Captain Ahab's epic hunt for the white whale Moby Dick, who once tore off one of his legs. Deeply interwoven with themes of obsession, revenge, and the struggle against the unknown, the novel offers a complex examination of the human soul and its conflicts.
Summary
The narrator, Ishmael, is a sailor who is about to leave Manhattan. Although he is quite experienced due to his experience in the merchant navy, he has decided to sign on with a whaler on his next voyage. On a December night, he arrives at an inn near New Bedford, Massachusetts, and agrees to share a bed with a stranger who is away at the time. When his roommate, a tattooed Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg, returns late at night and discovers Ishmael under his covers, the two men are startled by each other. They soon become friends and decide to set sail together from the island of Nantucket on the Pequod, a cannibalistic sailing ship adorned with the carved bones of its enemies. The ship is crewed by 30 sailors of all races and from all corners of the world.
It is commanded by an inflexible captain named Ahab, who does not appear to be on the ship and is described by one of the ship's owners as a large man with no religion who has been to university and among the cannibals. Shortly afterwards, the two friends meet a mysterious man on the quay with the biblical name Elijah, who alludes to future misfortune that will befall Ahab. The mysterious atmosphere intensifies on Christmas morning when Ishmael sees shadowy figures in the fog near the Pequod, which sets sail that day.
At first it is the ship's officers who determine the course, while Ahab remains locked in his cabin. The first officer is Starbuck, a serious and sincere man who also proves to be a skillful commander; the second is Stubb, carefree and cheerful, always with his pipe in his mouth; the third officer is Flask, stocky and short and completely trustworthy.
One morning, some time after departure, Ahab finally appears on the aft deck of the ship. He is an imposing and impressive figure, missing a leg from the knee down, which has been replaced by a prosthesis made from the jawbone of a sperm whale. Ahab reveals to the crew that the real target of the hunt is Moby Dick, a huge, old sperm whale with mottled skin and a hump as pale as snow, which mutilated him on his last whaling voyage. He will stop at nothing to kill the white whale. First mate Starbuck, who instead of hunting the whale wants to return home quietly to avoid hatred and revenge, finally obeys his captain.
When the spear is first launched to pursue a group of whales, Ishmael recognizes the men he saw in the fog before the Pequod sailed. Ahab had secretly brought his crew with him, including a harpooner named Fedallah, a Parsee, an enigmatic figure who exerts an ominous influence over Ahab and prophesies that they will meet their deaths together.
The novel describes numerous encounters between two ships on the open sea, in which there is only one question for Ahab, which he always asks the crew of the other ships - whether they have seen the white whale.
When the Pequod enters the Pacific Ocean, Queequeg falls seriously ill and asks the ship's carpenter to build a coffin for him. He recovers, however, and the coffin becomes his storage box, which is later sealed and fitted as a replacement for the Pequod's buoy.
News about Moby Dick comes from the crews of other whaling ships. Captain Boomer of the Samuel Enderby, who has lost an arm to the whale, is surprised by Ahab's burning rage. The ship Rachel asks for help in finding the captain's youngest son, who disappeared with his boat in a recent collision with the white whale. But the Pequod is now very close to Moby Dick, and Ahab does not stop to lend a hand. Finally, the Letizia is crossed while its captain has a sailor killed by Moby Dick thrown overboard. Starbuck, who sees disaster approaching, pleads with Ahab one last time in vain to reconsider his thirst for revenge.
The next day, the Pequod spots Moby Dick. For two days the crew chases the whale, which causes it great harm, including the disappearance at sea of the harpooner Fedallah, who turns out to be dead when Moby Dick surfaces on the third day. Starbuck, knowing that the sperm whale swimming away from the Pequod is not seeking the death of the whalers and that Ahab is obsessed with his revenge, urges Ahab one last time to let it go.
Ahab ignores the voice of reason for the umpteenth time and continues his disastrous hunt. Moby Dick has already damaged two of the three harpoons used to hunt him. Ahab rams his harpoon into the whale's flank. Moby Dick then lunges at the Pequod, which begins to sink badly damaged. A harpoon is fired, the line becomes entangled and Ahab bends down to free it. The line wraps itself around Ahab's neck. As the whale swims away, the captain is swept into the depths of the ocean. Even in the face of death, he curses Moby Dick. Almost all the crew members die in the whirlpool created by the ship's sinking. Only Ishmael manages to save himself by clinging to Queequeg's coffin and, after a day and a night, is fortunately rescued by the ship Rachel.
