Candide
Voltaire

"Candide" by Voltaire is a satirical novella and a quintessential work of the Enlightenment. The story follows the titular character, a naive young man, who is indoctrinated with the philosophy of Optimism—that "all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds." After being exiled from his sheltered home, Candide embarks on a global journey filled with absurd and horrific misfortunes that relentlessly challenge his optimistic worldview. The book is renowned for its biting wit, its critique of philosophical and religious dogma, and its fast-paced, picaresque adventure.
Summary
In the German region of Westphalia, the gentle and naive Candide lives in the castle of the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh. He is tutored by Dr. Pangloss, a philosopher who teaches that everything happens for a necessary and benevolent reason. When the Baron discovers Candide kissing his daughter, Cunégonde, he is violently expelled from this "earthly paradise." Candide is immediately forced into the brutal Bulgarian army. He witnesses the horrors of war and deserts, eventually making his way to Holland. There, he is aided by a kind Anabaptist named Jacques but also finds a destitute, syphilis-ridden Pangloss, who reports that the Baron's family, including Cunégonde, was slaughtered by soldiers.
Candide, Pangloss, and Jacques set sail for Lisbon, but their ship is wrecked in a storm, and Jacques drowns. They arrive just in time for a catastrophic earthquake. To prevent further disasters, the authorities of the Inquisition hold a public ceremony (an auto-da-fé), hanging Pangloss for his heretical philosophy and flogging Candide. An old woman tends to Candide's wounds and leads him to a house where he is miraculously reunited with Cunégonde. She survived the massacre and is now the shared mistress of a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, and the Grand Inquisitor. When her two patrons arrive, Candide kills them both in self-defense and flees with Cunégonde and the Old Woman to the Americas.
During the voyage, the Old Woman recounts her own tragic life story of being a princess who was captured, enslaved, and had one of her buttocks cannibalized. In Buenos Aires, the governor desires Cunégonde, forcing Candide to flee with his new, highly capable valet, Cacambo. They travel to Paraguay, where the Jesuit commander turns out to be Cunégonde's brother, who also survived the massacre. When Candide announces his intention to marry Cunégonde, her arrogant brother objects, and Candide is forced to stab him and flee again. After a brief, bizarre encounter with a native tribe, Candide and Cacambo stumble upon the legendary utopia of Eldorado, a land of immense wealth, scientific advancement, and rational harmony. Realizing that his old home was not the "best of all possible worlds," Candide leaves Eldorado with a fortune in jewels, determined to rescue Cunégonde.
Back in the real world, in Surinam, Candide is confronted by the cruelty of slavery and definitively renounces Pangloss's optimism. After being swindled out of much of his fortune, he hires Martin, a deeply pessimistic scholar, as a traveling companion. They journey through a corrupt Paris and a mad London before arriving in Venice. There, Candide is reunited with his former servant girl Paquette, now a prostitute, and dines with six dethroned kings, all lamenting their fate. He finally travels to Constantinople, where he finds and ransoms a galley slave crew that includes both Pangloss (who survived his hanging) and Cunégonde's brother (who survived his stabbing). He also finds Cunégonde, who has become ugly from hardship.
Candide buys a small farm and marries Cunégonde out of a sense of duty. The small group, now including the Old Woman, Cacambo, and Martin, is miserable and bored. After a brief consultation with a wise Dervish who tells them to stop pondering unanswerable questions, they meet an old Turkish farmer who has found contentment and prosperity through hard work. Inspired, Candide and his companions stop their philosophical debates and dedicate themselves to labor. Each finds a useful role, and Candide concludes with the novel's famous motto: "We must cultivate our garden."
