The Good Earth
Pearl S. Buck
*Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" is a sweeping epic novel that follows the life of Wang Lung, a humble Chinese peasant who, through diligent labor and a profound connection to the soil, rises from poverty to become a powerful landowner. The novel is not only a moving family saga but also a rich exploration of the corrupting nature of wealth, the erosion of traditional values, and the cyclical rise and fall of fortunes in early 20th-century China. Celebrated for its realistic portrayal of peasant life and its universal themes of human ambition, family, and our relationship with the land, the work earned Buck the Nobel Prize in Literature and remains a timeless classic.*
Summary
The novel opens as Wang Lung, a young peasant, leaves the small farm he shares with his father to go to the great house of the wealthy Hwang family. There, he is to claim his bride, O-lan, a slave in the household. On their way back to his home, the new couple stops at a small temple to the earth on the edge of Wang Lung's property to honor their union.
The first few years of their life together are prosperous. They work tirelessly in the fields, and O-lan gives birth to their first son. The harvests are good, and the family lives a fulfilling, albeit frugal, life. After some time, O-lan proudly takes her healthy toddler to the Hwang house to show him to her former masters, where she observes that the great family is facing financial hardship. She tells this to Wang Lung, who uses their savings to purchase a piece of the Hwangs' land, which gives him immense satisfaction as it once belonged to the family that had enslaved his wife.
Their prosperity continues, and O-lan bears another son. However, their good fortune does not last. Wang Lung’s shiftless uncle demands money, and family obligation compels an unwilling Wang Lung to give it to him. O-lan then gives birth to a daughter, which Wang Lung perceives as an evil omen in a time when females were called "slaves." Soon after, a severe drought begins. Despite the signs of coming hardship, Wang Lung buys more of the Hwang property. But owning land is of no use when the family, like their neighbors, begins to starve. One day, passing the temple of the earth, Wang Lung scorns the useless gods. As the famine worsens, his uncle spreads a rumor that Wang Lung is hiding food, prompting villagers to invade his house and steal the little he has left. During this raid, Wang Lung meets Ching, a poor but honest neighbor who participates only to feed his own child. Realizing the desperation of their situation, and with O-lan pregnant again, Wang Lung decides the family must travel south to the city. O-lan gives birth alone one night to a baby girl, whom she tells Wang Lung was born dead, though it is implied she killed the infant to spare it from a life of suffering. While O-lan is still weak, the family leaves their cherished farm for the city in search of work and food.
The family travels by "firewagon," or train, to the city of Kiangsu. There, they construct a simple hut out of mats against the wall of a rich man's house. Life is incredibly hard; Wang Lung pulls a ricksha for long hours while O-lan and their sons beg, and they barely earn enough to survive. In the city, Wang Lung is exposed to new ideas about Chinese society. He begins to hear from embittered city dwellers that the "rich who are too rich" are the source of his poverty, though he doesn't fully grasp these concepts of economic injustice.
After several months of this harsh life, rumors of an advancing enemy and impending war cause unrest. The wealthy begin to flee the city. Finally, the enemy breaks through the city gates, and the city erupts into chaos. The neighbors, with O-lan among them, storm the wealthy house against whose walls their huts are built, looting what they can. Wang Lung follows but cannot bring himself to steal. Inside, however, he confronts a fat, rich man who, terrified, gives Wang Lung a large amount of silver to spare his life. With this money, Wang Lung is able to take his family back to their land.
Using the silver to buy seed and tools, Wang Lung returns to his farm life. To bring good fortune, he once again burns incense at the temple of the earth. As O-lan reestablishes their home, a surprise increases their wealth further: Wang Lung discovers O-lan has a hidden stash of jewels she stole from the house in the city. He takes them all, allowing her to keep only two pearls. With this treasure, he buys large plots of land from the now-abandoned Hwang house, where only the old lord and a former concubine, Cuckoo, remain. Now a man of means, he hires the devoted Ching to help him work the land.
Around this time, Wang Lung realizes his first daughter is mentally disabled, likely due to the hardships of her early life. But the present is prosperous: O-lan gives birth to healthy twins, a boy and a girl, and they enjoy seven years of good fortune. Wang Lung is now a wealthy man and his social status is rising. Ashamed of his own illiteracy, he sends his first two sons to school.
A bad season follows when the land cannot be planted, leaving Wang Lung idle for the first time. Bored and restless, he begins to find fault with O-lan's plain appearance. He starts spending more time in town at a teahouse where Cuckoo now works. There, he becomes infatuated with a beautiful prostitute named Lotus. He grows distant from his family, buys jewels for Lotus, and even takes O-lan’s treasured pearls to give to her. His family life grows more complicated when his uncle, along with his wife and son, move into their home. The uncle’s shrewd wife helps Wang Lung arrange for Lotus and her maid, Cuckoo, to come live in his household as a concubine. O-lan is secretly bitter but suffers in silence.
Wang Lung's home life becomes increasingly complex. He arranges a marriage for his oldest son to the daughter of a rich townsman. He discovers his troublesome uncle is a member of a powerful gang of robbers, and is forced to cater to his demands. After discovering his oldest son, now a shallow "scholar," spending time with Lotus, Wang Lung sends him away to the south. He apprentices his second son to a merchant and promises his second daughter to the merchant’s son. Meanwhile, O-lan, having never complained, has become gravely ill. When Wang Lung finally notices her weakness, he realizes his neglect. As she lies dying, her last wish is to see her oldest son married. Wang Lung calls his son home for the wedding. Shortly after the elaborate ceremony, O-lan dies, followed weeks later by Wang Lung's aged father.
Though his wealth continues to grow, Wang Lung faces escalating family problems. His uncle and aunt are a constant burden, and their son lusts after Wang Lung’s second daughter. To keep the peace, Wang Lung sends the daughter to live with her future husband's family. With Cuckoo’s help, he gets his aunt and uncle addicted to opium, rendering them docile. His family's prosperity leads to changes in their lifestyle. The oldest son, obsessed with social prestige, convinces Wang Lung to move the family into the now-for-rent Hwang house in town. Wang Lung slowly grows accustomed to a more luxurious life. When his first grandson is born, he promises a gift to a temple in town, worrying he has betrayed the earth gods; the death of his loyal foreman, Ching, shortly thereafter seems to confirm this disloyalty.
Another sign of the family's shift from the land comes when his youngest son asks to learn to read. Though Wang Lung had hoped this son would continue the farming tradition, he reluctantly agrees. As Wang Lung ages, an incident sets off further changes. When soldiers enter the town, his cousin, now a soldier, camps in their house and demands a woman. He asks for Lotus’s young maid, Pear Blossom. Moved by her pleas, Wang Lung gives his cousin another woman instead. Lingering tension between Wang Lung and his restless youngest son, who speaks of joining the fight for China's freedom, comes to a head after Pear Blossom becomes Wang Lung's mistress. Discovering their relationship, the youngest son flees, and the family later hears he has become an officer in the "revolution."
The final chapters depict the bitter years of Wang Lung’s old age. He sees that his two older sons are neither wise nor care for the land. He realizes they will sell off the holdings he worked his entire life to build. In his last days, Wang Lung returns to his old earthen house on the farm, spending his time consumed by memories of the past, a wealthy but lonely and powerless old man.
