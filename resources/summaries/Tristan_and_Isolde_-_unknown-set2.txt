The story is about the tragic love between the noble knight Tristan and the beautiful Isolde, the wife of his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall. The legend of Tristan and Isolde is a complex and multi-layered story that interweaves numerous characters and plotlines. It unfolds against a backdrop of political intrigue, chivalry and personal struggles in the medieval world and is characterized by passion, betrayal, loyalty and tragic fate. The following summary is based on the version by the French novelist Joseph BÃ©dier (1864 - 1938).
Summary
Riwalin, King of Parmenie, marries Blanschefleur, the sister of Mark, King of Cornwall. Riwalin is later killed in an ambush by his enemy Morgan, even before his son Tristan is born. Shortly after Tristan's birth, his mother, Blanschefleur, also dies.
Tristan is then taken in by Rual, the Marshal of Riwalin. Rual raises him for seven years and then hands him over to Kurvenal, a squire, for further care. Later, his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, takes him in. During this time, Mark has to pay tribute to the King of Ireland. A few years later, Tristan decides to put an end to these tribute payments. On his arrival in Ireland, he has to fight the giant Morold, the brother-in-law of the Irish king. Although Tristan is hit by a poisoned sword, he manages to mortally wound Morold. With his last breath, Morold tells him that Isolde, the king's daughter, can cure the poison. Isolde cures Tristan of his poisoning, unaware that he has killed her uncle Morold. After his recovery, Tristan sails back to his uncle.
Mark wants his nephew to succeed him as ruler of Cornwall, but some lords are against this and prefer direct succession to the throne. The king decides that he will marry the woman who owns the golden hair that was laid down by two swallows that morning. Tristan remembers Isolde and suggests sending a message to the King of Ireland.
As soon as he arrives on land, Tristan has to fight and kill a terrible dragon, but is wounded in the process. For the second time, he is nursed by the king's daughter. Isolde discovers that the knight's sword bears a mark that matches a piece of iron found in Morold's skull; she realizes that it was Tristan who killed her uncle, but decides against revenge. Tristan completes his mission and Isolde's father agrees for his daughter to marry King Mark, providing an opportunity to settle the dispute between the two kingdoms. Isolde is somewhat annoyed by the lack of interest Tristan shows her, but prepares to sail to Britain.
The Irish queen gives Isolde's servant Brangaene, who is accompanying her on the journey, a magic potion. This potion, intended for the wedding night, is supposed to bind the newlyweds together in deep love and happiness for three years, so that separation would be unbearable or even fatal for them. On a warm midsummer night, Brangaene accidentally hands the potion to Tristan on the crossing from the festival land to the island. Assuming it is wine, Tristan quenches his thirst and also offers it to Isolde. The potion takes effect immediately. Despite this newly ignited, unshakeable love, Isolde marries King Mark. On their wedding night, however, the maid Brangaene takes Isolde's place in the king's bed, as she is still a virgin - unlike Isolde, who secretly slips into her husband's sheets in the early morning after a night in Tristan's arms.
After many adventures, the lovers, Tristan and Isolde, flee to the dark, impenetrable Wood of Morois. After three years, however, the magic of the love potion loses its effect. After a long search, King Mark finds the two of them asleep in a cave where they have sought refuge, with Tristan's sword stuck in the ground between them. The king interprets the sword as a sign of chastity and respects the purity of their feelings. He replaces Tristan's sword with his own, puts his ring on Isolde's finger and quietly leaves the cave.
When Tristan and Isolde awake, they realize that the king has spared them and forgiven them. As the magic of the potion has now worn off, they decide to part in great pain and Isolde returns to King Mark. Although the magical love has faded, they continue to love each other in a human way and now experience the poison of jealousy that was previously alien to them.
King Mark honors his wife and takes Isolde back in, but Tristan is banished due to the resentment of some barons. After some deliberation, Tristan moves to Brittany and finally marries Isolde of the White Hands, whose beauty and name remind him of the blonde Isolde. His main focus is on the craft of war, and he is seriously injured during a battle. Only Isolde, the wife of King Mark, can heal him. Tristan asks her to come to him and gives instructions that if she agrees to help him, the ship should return with a white sail. The ship does indeed carry a white sail, but Tristan's jealous wife, Isolde of the White Hands, whom he has never really appreciated, deceives him and claims that the sail is black. Believing he has been abandoned by his beloved Isolde, Tristan dies. When the wife of King Mark arrives and finds Tristan dead, she also dies of grief.
King Mark undertakes a sea voyage to bring back the bodies of the lovers and has them buried side by side in Cornwall. A bramble bush grows over their graves and connects them. It is also said that a rose bush blooms on Isolde's grave and a vine adorns Tristan's grave, so that their graves are so connected that no one can ever separate them.
