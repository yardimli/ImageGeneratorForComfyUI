Summary
In the Puritan town of Boston, Massachusetts, people gather to watch the chastisement of Hester Prynne, who has given birth to a child of unknown father. Her sentence: three hours of public shaming on a platform and the wearing of a red "A" for the rest of her life. Many women in the assembly disapprove her beauty and her calm, dignified demeanor. Despite insistence, Hester does not reveal the name of the child's father.
As she surveys the crowd, she spots a small, misshapen man and recognizes her husband, whom she thought was dead. When he witnesses Hester's humiliation, he inquires about her and learns of her illegitimate pregnancy. Angrily, he insists that the child's father should also pay and vows to uncover his identity. For this mission, he takes the name Roger Chillingworth.
Reverend John Wilson and Hester's vicar, Arthur Dimmesdale, urge her to reveal the father of her child, but she remains steadfast in her silence. On her return to the cell, Chillingworth, now working as a doctor, is called in to provide Hester and her child with medicinal herbs. He and Hester talk openly about her past, and although he presses for the name of the child's father, Hester insists on her silence. Chillingworth accepts her decision, but warns her not to reveal his true identity and threatens to destroy the father of her child. Hester defiantly agrees, although she fears she will one day regret it.
After her release from prison, Hester moves into a secluded house on the outskirts of town and makes a living doing excellent needlework. Living in seclusion with her daughter Pearl, she devotes herself to charity work and is troubled by Pearl's unusual fascination with the red "A". Pearl's isolation is compounded by her lack of friends and increasing naughtiness with age. Rumors arise, and church members aim to separate Pearl from her mother. When Hester learns of this, she seeks the support of Governor Bellingham and the clergymen Wilson and Dimmesdale. In desperation, she turns to Dimmesdale, who successfully persuades the governor to leave Pearl with Hester.
As Reverend Dimmesdale is in poor health, the townspeople welcome the support of Chillingworth, the newly arrived doctor, who now looks after their revered clergyman. Over time, Chillingworth begins to suspect a connection between Dimmesdale's illness and a hidden guilt. He exerts mental pressure on the vicar because he suspects that Dimmesdale is the father of Pearl's child. On one occasion when he lifts the robe of the sleeping Dimmesdale, Chillingworth sees a mark on his chest symbolizing the vicar's shame.
Plagued by guilt, Dimmesdale visits the place where Hester was once publicly humiliated. In the darkness of the night, he climbs the scaffold, admits his sin, but does not have the courage to make it public in the light of day. Hester, worried by Dimmesdale's condition, decides to break her promise of silence to Chillingworth.
Hester meets Dimmesdale in the woods and reveals her husband's true identity and his desire for revenge. She convinces Dimmesdale to flee with her secretly to Europe to start afresh. This idea revitalizes the priest and gives him new strength.
On election day, as the crowds leave the church, Dimmesdale gives a particularly moving sermon. He then climbs onto the scaffold, confesses his sin, collapses in Hester's arms and dies. Many of those present claim to have seen a scarlet "A" on his chest, although some claim the opposite. Chillingworth, who has lost his reason for revenge, dies shortly afterwards, leaving Pearl a considerable fortune.
After several years, Hester returns to her home on the outskirts of town, where she once again wears the red letter. After her death, she is buried next to Dimmesdale, and the two share a simple headstone.
