Aeneid
Virgil

The "Aeneid" by the Roman poet Virgil is a foundational epic of Western literature, commissioned by the Emperor Augustus. The poem tells the story of the Trojan hero Aeneas, who, after the fall of Troy, endures a long and arduous journey to fulfill his destiny: to found a new city in Italy that will one day become the mighty Roman Empire. The epic is renowned for its exploration of duty, fate, and the profound human cost of building an empire.
Summary
After the Trojan War, Aeneas and his fellow Trojan survivors are caught in a fierce storm sent by the goddess Juno, who despises the Trojans because she knows their descendants are fated to destroy her favorite city, Carthage. The fleet shipwrecks on the coast of North Africa, near Carthage itself. Aeneas's mother, the goddess Venus, appeals to Jupiter, who reassures her of Rome's glorious destiny. Aeneas enters the prosperous city of Carthage and is welcomed by its queen, Dido. At a grand banquet, Venus sends Cupid to make Dido fall passionately in love with Aeneas.

At Dido's request, Aeneas recounts the fall of Troy, including the famous tale of the Trojan Horse. He describes his frantic escape from the burning city, carrying his elderly father, Anchises, and leading his young son, Iulus, but losing his wife in the chaos. He then tells of his seven years of wandering, guided by prophecies that he is destined to found a great city in Italy, a journey that led him to Carthage just after the death of his father in Sicily.

Consumed by a divinely-inspired passion, Dido begins an affair with Aeneas. They live together for several months until Jupiter, concerned that Aeneas is neglecting his destiny, sends a messenger to command him to leave. Though torn, Aeneas dutifully prepares his fleet to sail in secret. When Dido discovers his impending departure, she is driven to madness by grief and rage. As Aeneas's ships sail away, she curses him and his descendants before tragically killing herself on a funeral pyre.

The Trojans land in Sicily to hold funeral games in honor of Anchises. There, Aeneas's father appears to him in a dream and instructs him to visit the underworld. Guided by the prophetess Sibyl, Aeneas enters the land of the dead. He confronts the shade of Dido, who silently turns away from him, and then travels to the Elysian Fields. There, his father's spirit shows him a parade of the souls of future Roman heroes, including Augustus himself, revealing the grand history that Aeneas is destined to set in motion.

Aeneas and his men finally arrive in Latium, Italy, their promised homeland. The local king, Latinus, welcomes them and offers his daughter, Lavinia, in marriage to Aeneas, in accordance with recent omens. However, Juno intervenes again, sending a Fury to incite hatred against the Trojans. The Fury enrages Lavinia's mother and her former suitor, the fierce warrior Turnus. When Aeneas's son Iulus accidentally kills a pet deer, the simmering tensions erupt into open war between the Trojans and the Latins.

Despairing, Aeneas is visited in a dream by the river god Tiber, who advises him to seek allies. He travels to the future site of Rome, where he secures the help of the Arcadian King Evander, who sends his beloved son Pallas to fight alongside Aeneas. Venus delivers a set of divine armor to her son, forged by the god Vulcan. The shield is intricately carved with scenes of Rome's future glory, a destiny Aeneas carries without fully understanding it.

In Aeneas's absence, Turnus attacks the Trojan camp. When Aeneas returns with his allies, a massive battle ensues. In the fighting, Turnus kills the young Pallas and takes his swordbelt as a trophy. Enraged and grief-stricken, Aeneas goes on a bloody rampage. The war rages on, with another tragic loss in the death of the warrior-maiden Camilla.

Finally, Turnus agrees to end the bloodshed by facing Aeneas in single combat. As they fight, Juno makes a final pact with Jupiter: she will cease her opposition if the victorious Trojans agree to adopt the Latin language and customs, effectively merging with the people they have conquered. Jupiter agrees. Aeneas wounds Turnus, who begs for his life. Aeneas hesitates, but then he sees Pallas's swordbelt on Turnus's shoulder. Overcome by fury, he kills his foe, and the epic ends with the image of Turnus's soul fleeing to the underworld.
