The Tempest
William Shakespeare
"The Tempest" by William Shakespeare is a romance and tragicomedy that tells the story of an exiled duke who uses his magical powers to orchestrate a storm, shipwreck his enemies on his island, and ultimately regain his position as Duke of Milan. The play takes place on an enchanted, dreamlike island where Prospero, the exiled duke, has perfected his magical art. Through a series of illusions and manipulations, he tests the character of his old foes, brings his daughter a suitor, and explores profound themes of justice, forgiveness, nature versus civilization, and freedom. It is widely considered to be one of Shakespeare's last great plays and a reflection on his own art as a playwright.
Summary
The play begins with a terrible storm threatening a ship carrying Alonso, the King of Naples, his brother Sebastian, his son Ferdinand, the acting Duke of Milan, Antonio, and the old councilor Gonzalo. As the ship breaks apart, the royal passengers are forced overboard.
On a nearby island, the magician Prospero explains to his daughter, Miranda, that the wreck was an illusion he created with his magic and that no one was harmed. He reveals that twelve years earlier, he was the rightful Duke of Milan, but he neglected his duties for his magical studies, allowing his treacherous brother, Antonio, to banish him and the infant Miranda with the help of Alonso. They only survived because the kindly Gonzalo secretly supplied their boat with food, water, and Prospero's books. Now, fate has brought his enemies to the island, giving Prospero the chance to reclaim his dukedom.
Prospero's servant, the spirit Ariel, reports that he has carried out the plan perfectly, bringing the passengers ashore in three separate groups: Alonso and his men; the butler Stephano and the clown Trinculo; and Alonso's son, Ferdinand. Prospero then calls for his other servant, the monstrous Caliban, son of the dead witch Sycorax who once ruled the island. Caliban curses Prospero, claiming the island as his own, but Prospero, remembering Caliban’s past attempt to assault Miranda, keeps him in line with threats of magical torment. Ariel then uses music to lead the lost Ferdinand to Prospero and Miranda, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Although he secretly approves, Prospero feigns hostility and enslaves Ferdinand to test the prince's love for Miranda.
Elsewhere on the island, Gonzalo attempts to comfort King Alonso, who believes Ferdinand has drowned. Antonio and Sebastian cruelly mock Gonzalo and blame Alonso for their predicament. While the invisible Ariel lulls the party to sleep with solemn music, Antonio convinces Sebastian to murder the sleeping king and seize the throne of Naples. However, the alert Ariel awakens Alonso and Gonzalo just in time, foiling the plot.
Meanwhile, Caliban, out collecting wood, encounters the jester Trinculo and the drunken butler Stephano. Captivated by Stephano’s liquor, Caliban pledges to worship him as a new god.
Ferdinand finds joy in the menial tasks Prospero assigns him, as they are for the love of Miranda. The two secretly pledge to marry, watched by an approving, unseen Prospero. Nearby, Caliban proposes a plan to his new master, Stephano: they will murder Prospero in his sleep, allowing Stephano to become king of the island and take Miranda for himself. Ariel overhears the plot and rushes to warn Prospero. Later, as Alonso's weary party rests, Prospero stages an illusion: spirits present a lavish feast, but just as the men are about to eat, Ariel appears as a harpy and makes the banquet vanish. He accuses Alonso, Antonio, and Sebastian of their crime against Prospero, declaring the shipwreck and the loss of Ferdinand to be their punishment.
Prospero frees Ferdinand from servitude, explaining the enslavement was merely a trial of his love. To celebrate their betrothal, he commands Ariel to stage a masque, in which spirits disguised as Roman gods bless the couple. Prospero abruptly ends the celebration when he remembers Caliban's murder plot. He and Ariel set a trap by hanging beautiful clothing outside his cave. When Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo arrive, the latter two are distracted by the garments. Prospero then unleashes spirit hounds to chase the conspirators away.
With all his enemies now in his power, Prospero is told by Ariel that the king and his followers are trapped in a nearby grove, stunned with guilt and fear. Feeling a pang of pity, Prospero decides that forgiveness is a nobler path than vengeance. He vows to give up his magic once his plans are complete. He confronts the three noblemen, reveals his identity as the rightful Duke of Milan, and forgives them. To a repentant Alonso, who is still mourning his son, Prospero reveals Ferdinand and Miranda playing chess. Father and son are joyfully reunited.
The ship's boatswain arrives to report that their vessel is miraculously safe and sound. Caliban, brought forward, repents his rebellion and promises to be loyal. Prospero invites everyone into his cell for the night, promising to tell them his story and saying they will all set sail for Naples the next day for the wedding. His final act is to set Ariel free. Left alone on stage, Prospero delivers an epilogue, explaining he has given up his magic and asks the audience for their applause to grant him his own freedom from the island.
