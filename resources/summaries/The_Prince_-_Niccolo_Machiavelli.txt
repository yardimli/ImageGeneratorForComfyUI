The Prince
Niccolo Machiavelli
"The Prince" by Niccolo Machiavelli is a seminal work of political philosophy and one of the first works of modern political science. Written in the early 16th century, it is a practical handbook outlining the rules for a ruler—or "prince"—to gain, maintain, and expand political power. Rejecting traditional notions of morality and Christian virtue in governance, Machiavelli argues that a prince must be willing to use deception, cruelty, and force to preserve the stability and security of the state. The treatise was written during a time of great political turmoil in Italy, which was fragmented into warring city-states and vulnerable to foreign invasion. Machiavelli dedicated the work to Lorenzo II de' Medici, hoping that a strong leader would adopt his principles to unify Italy and restore it to its former glory.

Summary
Exiled from his beloved Florence in 1512 after the powerful Medici family returned to power and dissolved the republic he had served, Niccolò Machiavelli penned "The Prince" one year later. Longing to return to public service, he presented the work as a gift to the new ruler, Lorenzo II de' Medici, offering his sharp political insights as the key to solving the problems plaguing Italy. He saw Lorenzo as the potential savior who could unify the fractious Italian city-states into a single, powerful nation capable of repelling foreign invaders.

Machiavelli begins by outlining the two basic forms of government: republics and monarchies. He sets aside the topic of republics for another work and focuses exclusively on monarchies, or "principalities," exploring how they are acquired and maintained. He notes that it is easiest to rule a hereditary state, where the prince's family has governed for generations. The people are accustomed to the ruling family, and the prince can maintain power without harsh measures, ensuring their loyalty through stability and tradition.

New monarchies, however, are fraught with difficulty. A prince who adds a new territory to his existing one—a "mixed" monarchy—faces immediate challenges. The people who may have initially welcomed him can quickly turn if he offends them. If the newly annexed territory shares the same language, religion, and customs, it is easier to control, especially if the old ruling family is extinct and the prince avoids drastic changes to laws and taxes. If the territory is different, the prince must take more decisive action. The best option is for the prince to reside in the conquered territory himself, as this allows him to address problems immediately. Alternatively, he can establish colonies of his own people, which are cheaper than maintaining a standing army and create a loyal link to the new province. A wise prince will also manage his neighbors, protecting weaker ones to keep them as allies while weakening more powerful ones to prevent them from becoming a threat.

A prince can acquire territory through military skill ("virtue") or by luck ("fortune"). Those who win power through their own abilities, like the great historical examples of Moses, Cyrus, and Romulus, find it easier to maintain control. In contrast, those who gain principalities through luck or the power of others, either by purchasing it or receiving it as a favor, have a much harder time. They often lack experience and depend on the goodwill of others. Machiavelli uses Cesare Borgia as a key example of a prince who acquired his state through the influence of his father, Pope Alexander VI. Though Borgia was ruthless and effective—forming his own army, eliminating rivals, and bringing a brutal order to his territory—his success was ultimately cut short when his father died and a hostile new pope took power, demonstrating the precariousness of power built on fortune.

Machiavelli observes that even cruel and inhumane rulers can hold power if their actions are perceived as bringing stability. He advises that if a prince must be cruel, the cruelty should be inflicted all at once, so the shock is brief and the subjects can forget. Benefits, however, should be given out slowly, a little at a time, so that the prince always appears generous. Sometimes a private citizen becomes a prince through the support of his fellow townspeople, creating a "civic principality." If he rises with the help of the nobles, he must work to make them dependent on him, as they may see themselves as his equals. If he is elevated by the ordinary people, his task is easier, as long as he treats them fairly. In either case, the prince must ensure the people feel they need him for their protection and well-being, thus securing their loyalty. Finally, he notes that "ecclesiastical principalities," those controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, are exceptionally easy to hold because they are defended by ancient religious customs that are so powerful that potential invaders are reluctant to attack.

The foundation of a powerful state, Machiavelli insists, is a strong army. A prince must therefore focus on the art of war above all else, studying it even in times of peace by reading history and modeling himself on great warriors of the past. He strongly warns against using mercenaries or soldiers from other regions, as they are disloyal and unreliable. The only truly effective army is one composed of the prince's own citizens, who are well-trained and loyal to their state.

While it is admirable for a prince to be seen as generous, merciful, and trustworthy, Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be pragmatic. Since most men do not possess all virtuous qualities, a prince must avoid the faults that would cause him to lose his state. In fact, if a vice proves useful to the state, he should not fear the scandal it might cause. For example, being seen as a spendthrift can lead to ruin, so it is better to be considered "miserly" and manage the state's finances wisely than to burden the people with heavy taxes. Though it would be ideal to be both loved and feared, if a choice must be made, it is safer to be feared. Machiavelli believes humans are selfish and untrustworthy, more likely to break a bond of love than to defy a ruler they fear. A prince must, however, avoid being hated, which can lead to conspiracies. The wise ruler also understands that it is not necessary to keep his word if deception will better serve the state, but he must always maintain the *appearance* of being generous, merciful, and deeply religious. When dealing with his subjects and advisors, the prince must surround himself with a few men of good judgment who will speak the truth, but he must avoid flatterers at all costs and ultimately make all decisions himself and stick to them.

Machiavelli concludes by addressing the political problems of 16th-century Italy. He argues that Italian princes have lost their states not through bad luck, but through their own incompetence—they failed to build their own armies, did not befriend their people, and neglected to control their nobles. While many believe that life is governed by God or chance ("fortune"), Machiavelli contends that fortune controls no more than half of human affairs, and that a "virtuous" prince—one who is courageous, intelligent, and flexible—can take control of his own destiny. Because circumstances change, a successful prince must adapt his methods, and it is better to be bold and rush into action than to be overly cautious, "for fortune is a woman and it is necessary, if you wish to master her, to conquer her by force." He ends with a passionate appeal to the Medici family, specifically Lorenzo II, to take up his principles. He urges him to heal Italy's wounds, arm its people into a national army, and unify the fragmented states into one great nation, thereby reviving the honor and dignity of an Italy that was heir to the glorious Roman Empire and freeing it from the domination of foreign powers.
