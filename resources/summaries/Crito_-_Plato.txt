Four Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo
Plato

Written by the Greek philosopher Plato, these four dialogues chronicle the final days of his mentor, Socrates, who was tried and executed by the state of Athens in 399 B.C. Outraged by the death of a man he considered the wisest and most just, Plato immortalized Socrates' ideas and character through these works. Using the "Socratic method" of questioning, the dialogues present Socrates not as a lecturer, but as a relentless seeker of truth who engages others in conversation to challenge their assumptions. Together, the Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo form a powerful dramatic and philosophical sequence, exploring timeless questions of piety, justice, civic duty, and the immortality of the soul.
Summary
The narrative begins in the Euthyphro, just hours before Socrates' trial. Outside the Athenian law court, Socrates encounters Euthyphro, a professional prophet who is there to prosecute his own father for the accidental death of a servant. Euthyphro is supremely confident that this action is pious and that he understands the true nature of holiness. Intrigued by this certainty, Socrates, who is himself on trial for impiety, asks Euthyphro to define piety. Euthyphro first offers his own lawsuit as an example, but Socrates dismisses this, asking for a universal definition, not a single instance. Euthyphro then defines piety as "what is dear to the gods." Socrates skillfully dismantles this by pointing out that the myths describe the gods as constantly quarreling, meaning the same act could be both pious and impious. The discussion leads to the central philosophical question of the dialogue: Is something pious because the gods love it, or do the gods love it because it is, by its own nature, pious? Unable to provide a satisfactory answer and trapped by Socrates' logic, a flustered Euthyphro makes an excuse and hurries away, leaving the fundamental question of piety unresolved.

The Apology (from the Greek apologia, meaning "defense") presents Socrates' speech at his trial. Facing a jury of 501 Athenians, Socrates addresses the long-standing prejudice against him, which he traces back to a pronouncement from the Oracle at Delphi that no man was wiser than he. Puzzled, Socrates set out to disprove the oracle by questioning Athens's most respected politicians, poets, and craftsmen. He discovered that while they had expertise in their specific fields, they mistakenly believed this made them wise in all other matters. Socrates concluded that he was indeed wiser, but only because he alone was aware of his own ignorance. This relentless questioning, however, earned him many enemies by making powerful men look foolish. He then cross-examines his main accuser, Meletos, exposing the illogical and contradictory nature of the charges that he both believes in strange new gods and is also a complete atheist. Socrates declares that he is a "gadfly" sent by the gods to stir the lazy horse of the Athenian state, and he will not abandon his divine mission of philosophical inquiry even to save his own life. After being found guilty by a narrow margin, he rejects conventional punishments like exile, instead audaciously proposing that the state should reward him with free meals for his service. The jury, provoked, sentences him to death. In his final address, Socrates consoles his supporters, arguing that death is not to be feared, as it is either a peaceful, dreamless sleep or a journey to another world where he can continue his questioning among the heroes of the past. He concludes that "no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death."

The Crito takes place in Socrates' prison cell two days before his scheduled execution. His elderly and wealthy friend, Crito, arrives with a detailed plan to bribe the guards and arrange for Socrates' escape into exile. Crito pleads with Socrates, arguing that by staying, Socrates is betraying his children and allowing his friends to be shamed for not saving him. Socrates, calm as ever, dismisses these concerns, stating that the opinion of the majority is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is living a just life. He argues that it is wrong to respond to injustice with another injustice. To escape would be to break the law, a clear injustice. He then imagines the Laws of Athens speaking to him, arguing that he has entered into a social contract with the state. Having lived his entire life in Athens, benefiting from its protection, education, and order, he has implicitly agreed to abide by its legal judgments. To flee now would be to become a destroyer of the laws, undermining the very foundation of the state that nurtured him. Convinced by this powerful reasoning, Crito abandons his plan and accepts that Socrates must follow his principles to the end.

The final dialogue, the Phaedo, recounts the last hours of Socrates' life, as told by his friend Phaedo. Surrounded by his grieving followers, Socrates is remarkably cheerful and engages them in a final philosophical discussion on the immortality of the soul. He argues that a true philosopher "practices for death" his entire life, because philosophy is the act of training the soul to detach from the desires and distractions of the body. Since the soul can grasp pure concepts like Beauty, Justice, and Goodness only when it is free from the body, death is not an end but a liberation. He offers several proofs for the soul's survival: that knowledge is a form of recollection from a past existence; that opposites like life and death must generate one another in a cycle; and that the soul, being invisible, simple, and divine-like, cannot be scattered and destroyed like the physical body. When his friends Simmias and Cebes raise objections, comparing the soul to a fragile harmony or a cloak that eventually wears out, Socrates patiently refutes their analogies. As his final moments approach, he bids a calm farewell to his wife and children, thanks the jailer, and drinks the poisonous hemlock without hesitation. His last act is to remind Crito to pay a small debt, and he dies peacefully, demonstrating to the end his mastery over fear and his unwavering commitment to his philosophical life.
