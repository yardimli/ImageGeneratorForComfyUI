The Divine Comedy
Dante Alighieri


The "Divine Comedy" is an epic poem that represents a high point of Italian literature. It comprises 14,233 verses arranged in tercets (three-liners) and takes the reader on a journey through the three realms of the afterlife: Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio) and Heaven (Paradiso). The Italian poet Dante is accompanied on this journey by various guides; the best known is the Roman poet Virgil. The "Divine Comedy" is not only a religious allegorical epic, but also a commentary on human nature and the political and cultural landscape of medieval Europe. Written in Italian, the poem played a decisive role in establishing the Tuscan dialect as standard Italian.
Summary
Inferno
The plot of the "Divine Comedy" begins on Maundy Thursday in the year 1300, when Dante, aged 35, gets lost in a dark wooded landscape. He meets the Roman poet Virgil, who has been sent by Dante's lover Beatrice to guide him on a journey through the underworld. The two of them traverse the nine circles of hell, where sinners suffer different punishments for their sins. The sins increase in severity the deeper they descend into hell until they finally meet Lucifer at the lowest point. After meeting Lucifer, they ascend and leave hell, ready to continue their journey through purgatory.
Each circle of hell involves a punishment proportional to the sin committed, a principle known as contrapasso. Some of the circles and their sins include:
1. limbo: the home of souls who lived decently but were not baptized, as well as the ancient "great spirits" who served humanity.
2. the lustful souls, including well-known historical and mythological figures such as Semiramis, Cleopatra and Helen of Troy.
3. the gluttons who are immersed in stinking mud and threatened by Cerberus, the third guardian of hell.
4. the miserly and the profligate, eternally condemned to roll heaps of stones around the circle.
5. the angry and the indifferent who are punished in the muddy waters of the Styx.
6. those who deliberately sin against their conscience, including Epicureans and heretics.
7. the violent, including those who committed violence against themselves (suicides) and against God, nature and art.
8. the deceitful, including ruffians, seducers, hypocrites, thieves and deceitful counselors.
9. the traitors, divided into four zones for those who have betrayed their relatives, their country, their hosts and their benefactors.
This tour of hell serves not only to illustrate the sins and punishments that await the damned, but also to explore Dante's literary and political perspectives. His encounters with historical and fictional figures allow him to reflect on moral issues and develop his own views on right and wrong.
Purgatorio
After surviving the depths of hell, Dante and Virgil emerge from the underworld on the beach of an island on the other side of the world. There they see the mountain of purgatory, up which the souls of the dead who have repented ascend. This mountain is divided into seven circles. In contrast to hell, where screaming and wailing predominate, purgatory is filled with harmonious sounds. Every sinner finds himself in a place that is a direct reminder of his transgressions and where examples of people who have distinguished themselves through the opposite of their sins are constantly brought up. If the penitents repent of their sins, they are allowed to climb further up the mountain until they finally reach the entrance to paradise. The prayers of the living can help them to open these gates.
1st circle: Those who are guilty of the sin of pride are bowed down by a heavy burden on their shoulders.
2nd circle: The eyes of those who are guilty of the sin of envy are sewn up with wire.
3rd circle: Those guilty of the sin of anger are enveloped in an impenetrable smoke.
4th circle: Those guilty of the sin of sloth are forced to run incessantly.
5th circle: Those guilty of the sin of covetousness lie face down on the ground.
6th circle: Those guilty of the sin of gluttony are exhausted and suffer Tantalus' torment.
7th circle: Those guilty of the sin of lust must pass through a wall of flame.
The ascent is repeatedly interrupted by encounters with various people whom Dante knows or who are famous (such as Arnaut Daniel, Adrian V. and others). After reaching the earthly paradise at the top of the mountain, Vergil leaves Dante and returns to hell. Beatrice appears to pick Dante up, guide him and "ascend to the stars".
Paradiso
In the final phase of Dante's journey, Beatrice guides him through the nine celestial spheres of heaven. While the previous spheres, the Inferno and the Purgatorio, are based on various forms of sin, the Paradiso is based on the four cardinal virtues - prudence, fortitude, justice and temperance - and the three theological virtues - faith, hope and love.
The lower seven spheres represent the cardinal virtues, with the first three spheres showing deficiencies in these virtues: the moon represents inconstancy, Mercury symbolizes a lack of justice and Venus embodies a lack of temperance. The following four spheres, on the other hand, illustrate positive examples of the virtues: The Sun stands for wisdom, Mars for bravery, Jupiter for justice and Saturn for moderation.
These seven spheres are supplemented by two higher levels: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars represents those who have achieved the theological virtues and stands for the triumphant church. The ninth circle, the Primum Mobile, houses the blameless angels. The highest sphere, the Empyrean, houses the essence of God himself and completes the heavenly order.
On his journey, Dante meets and talks to important saints. The Paradiso is therefore more theological than the previous parts. However, Dante's vision of heaven is his personal interpretation, limited by his human perception.
The Divine Comedy ends when Dante beholds the Trinity of God. In an indescribable moment of understanding, he grasps the mystery of Christ's divinity and humanity and aligns his soul with divine love.
