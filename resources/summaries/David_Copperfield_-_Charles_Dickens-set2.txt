Summary
The story follows the life of David Copperfield, from his birth to adult maturity. David is born six months after the death of his father in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, and spends his early years happily with his loving mother and the warm-hearted housekeeper Clara Peggotty. Everyone calls him Davy. When he is seven years old, his mother marries Edward Murdstone without telling him about the forthcoming wedding. David is sent to live with Peggotty's relatives in Yarmouth, where the fisherman Mr. Peggotty lives in an abandoned boat with his adopted niece Emily, his nephew Ham and the widow Mrs. Gummidge. David falls in love with "little Emily" and they call him Master Copperfield.
On his return, David discovers that his mother has married and immediately takes a dislike to his stepfather Murdstone, who believes in strict and even brutal parenting methods. This dislike also extends to Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves in shortly afterwards. Together they torment David's mother and make life hell for her and David. When David performs badly at school, Murdstone tries to hit him, whereupon David bites him. He is then sent to Salem House, a boarding school, which is run by the unmerciful principal Mr. Creakle. There he makes friends with James Steerforth and Tommy Traddles. Steerforth, whom he regards as a noble person, arouses in him a deep admiration as he gives him well-deserved attention.
During the holidays, David returns home and learns that his mother has given birth to a son. Soon after his return to Salem House, however, his mother and the newborn die, prompting David to return home immediately. Meanwhile, Peggotty marries the local carter, Mr. Barkis. Murdstone arranges a job for David in London with a wine merchant, a company in which Murdstone has a stake. A few months later, David's good-natured but profligate landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is sent to King's Bench Prison for debt. During a visit, Micawber advises David to visit his eccentric and kind-hearted great-aunt Betsey Trotwood in Dover. After Micawber's release and move to Plymouth, David is left alone in London and decides to escape to his aunt. Although she had angrily abandoned him at birth because he was not a girl, she takes David in and resists Murdstone's attempt to reclaim custody. She encourages him to fulfill the expectations she had for the girl who was never born.
David's aunt allows him to attend a prestigious school run by the kindly Dr. Strong, who instills decency and self-confidence in his students. During the school year, David lives with the lawyer Mr. Wickfield and his daughter Agnes, who becomes a close friend and confidante to David. Wickfield's employee, Uriah Heep, also lives in the same household.
Through deception and manipulation, Uriah Heep succeeds in gradually taking control of the ageing and alcohol-weakened Wickfield, much to Agnes' distress. Heep insidiously reveals to David his desire to marry Agnes. With the help of Micawber, who works as Heep's secretary, Heep's deceitful behavior is finally exposed. Later in the book, David meets Heep again in prison, where he is serving time for attempting to defraud the Bank of England.
After David finishes school, he begins training as a paralegal. During this time, his aunt's fortune dwindles as it has been damaged by Heep's dishonest actions. David is forced to work hard to earn a living. He takes a job as a secretary to his former teacher Dr. Strong and begins to learn shorthand, helped by his old school friend Traddles, after covering debates in Parliament for a newspaper. Thanks to the constant moral support of Agnes and his own tireless efforts and hard work, David finally achieves fame and fortune as a writer of novels.
Steerforth, David's charming but selfish school friend who has renewed his relationship with David, seduces and dishonors Emily before giving her to his servant Littimer to marry and leaving her behind in Europe. Emily's uncle, Mr. Peggotty, tracks her down with the help of Martha, who grew up in her home region and later moved to London. Ham, who was engaged to Emily before the tragedy, loses his life in a violent storm off the coast while trying to help a ship in distress. Steerforth was on this ship and is also killed. Mr. Peggotty takes Emily to Australia, where he starts a new life with her, Mrs. Gummidge and the Micawbers, and they all find happiness and security there.
Meanwhile, David falls head over heels in love with Dora Spenlow and marries her. The marriage is challenging for David in terms of everyday life together, but his love for her remains unshakeable. Dora dies early in the marriage after a tragic miscarriage. After Dora's death, Agnes helps David to collect himself and return to his normal life and his career as a writer. During a stay in Switzerland, where he comes to terms with his grief over his many losses, David realizes that his feelings for Agnes go deeper. On his return to England, he finally confesses his love for Agnes, and she discovers that she has the same feelings for him. They soon marry, and it is in this union that David finds his true happiness. Together, David and Agnes have several children, including a daughter whom they name after his great-aunt Betsey Trotwood.
