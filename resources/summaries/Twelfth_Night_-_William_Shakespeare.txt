Twelfth Night
William Shakespeare
"Twelfth Night" by William Shakespeare is considered one of his most perfect comedies, a witty and bright play that tells the story of a shipwrecked twin brother and sister who are separated and believe each other to be dead. Their eventual reunion comes only after a complex and humorous series of mistaken identities, romantic entanglements, and elaborate pranks. The play explores themes of love, youth, and the pursuit of pleasure with universal appeal, all set in the enchanting, romantic land of Illyria.

Summary
The play opens in Illyria, where Duke Orsino pines for the love of the noble Lady Olivia. He sends his page, Valentine, to her, but learns that she has sworn off the company of men for seven years to mourn her recently deceased brother. Meanwhile, on the coast, a young woman named Viola survives a shipwreck she fears has claimed the life of her twin brother, Sebastian. Finding herself alone in a strange land, Viola decides to disguise herself as a young man named Cesario and enters the service of Duke Orsino.
At Olivia’s home, her boisterous, drunken uncle, Sir Toby Belch, carouses with his foolish knight companion, Sir Andrew Aguecheek, whom he has brought as a potential suitor for his niece. They are frequently scolded by Olivia's gentlewoman, Maria.
Orsino, quickly growing fond of "Cesario," sends the disguised Viola to woo Olivia on his behalf. This pains Viola, who has already fallen in love with the Duke herself. Cesario goes to Olivia’s house, where the clown Feste mocks Olivia’s excessive mourning. After much persistence, Cesario is granted an audience with the veiled Olivia. Though she rejects Orsino's suit, she is instantly captivated by the handsome young messenger. To ensure "his" return, Olivia sends her arrogant steward, Malvolio, after Cesario with a ring, falsely claiming "he" left it behind.
Elsewhere, Viola's brother, Sebastian, has also washed ashore, saved by a sea captain named Antonio. Believing Viola drowned, Sebastian heads for Orsino's court, and although Antonio has enemies there, his devotion compels him to follow.
When Malvolio catches up to Cesario and tries to return the ring, Viola realizes Olivia has fallen in love with her male disguise. She laments the complicated love triangle: she loves Orsino, Orsino loves Olivia, and Olivia loves her as Cesario.
Late one night, Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Feste are singing and drinking loudly. Maria’s warnings to be quiet are ignored. The puritanical Malvolio emerges to berate them for their noise, threatening to report their behavior to Olivia. After he leaves, Maria devises a plan for revenge: she will forge a love letter in Olivia’s handwriting to trick Malvolio into believing Olivia is in love with him. Toby and Andrew are thrilled with the plot. Hiding in the garden, they, along with a servant named Fabian, watch as Malvolio finds the letter. The letter instructs him to prove his love by smiling constantly in Olivia's melancholic presence, behaving rudely to Sir Toby, and wearing absurd yellow stockings with cross-garters—a color and fashion Olivia despises.
Cesario returns to Olivia, who openly confesses her love. Cesario gently rejects her, famously stating, "I am not what I am." Seeing Sir Andrew’s jealousy over Olivia’s affection for Cesario, Sir Toby encourages the cowardly knight to challenge Cesario to a duel. As this prank unfolds, Antonio finds Sebastian in the city, gives him his wallet for safekeeping, and arranges to meet him later at an inn.
The trick on Malvolio comes to fruition when he appears before Olivia, smiling inanely and dressed in his ridiculous yellow stockings. Believing him to be mad, Olivia asks her servants to look after him, which allows Toby, Maria, and Fabian to lock him in a dark room as a supposed madman. Sir Toby verbally delivers Andrew's challenge to a terrified Cesario. Though neither wants to fight, they draw their swords. At that moment, Antonio appears. Mistaking Cesario for Sebastian, he intervenes to defend his friend. When officers arrive and arrest Antonio, he asks Cesario for his wallet back. Viola’s confusion and denial of knowing him enrage Antonio, but his mention of saving a young man named Sebastian from the sea gives Viola her first hope that her brother is alive.
Later, Feste finds the real Sebastian and mistakes him for Cesario. Sir Andrew arrives and, also thinking he is Cesario, strikes him. Sebastian, unlike Viola, fights back, soundly beating Andrew. Sir Toby draws his sword to intervene, but Olivia enters, stops the fight, and scolds Toby. Believing Sebastian to be Cesario, she professes her love for him again. A bewildered but delighted Sebastian agrees to her proposal, and they go off to be married by a priest. Meanwhile, Feste, disguised as a curate named Sir Topas, torments the imprisoned Malvolio, trying to convince him that he is insane.
The final act takes place at Olivia’s house, where Duke Orsino has come with Cesario. Confusion erupts when Olivia enters and addresses Cesario as her husband, a claim validated by the priest. The situation becomes more chaotic with the arrival of the injured Sir Toby and Sir Andrew, who blame Cesario for their wounds. Finally, Sebastian appears, and for a moment, everyone is stunned by the presence of two identical Cesarios. The twins recognize each other, and the mystery is solved. Viola reveals her true identity, and Orsino, realizing the woman he has grown so fond of is in love with him, asks her to marry him. With the marriages of Olivia and Sebastian, and Orsino and Viola, order is restored. A letter from Malvolio arrives, accusing Olivia of wronging him. Fabian confesses the prank, revealing Maria as the author, and adds that she and Sir Toby have since married. Released from his prison, Malvolio is not appeased and exits swearing, “I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you!” The play ends with the happy couples celebrating, but a final, melancholic song from Feste reminds the audience that outside the world of romance, "the rain it raineth every day."
