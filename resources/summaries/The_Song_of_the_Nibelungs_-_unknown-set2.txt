The plot of the Song of the Nibelungs can be divided into two parts: the Siegfried part and the Kriemhild part.
Summary
Part 1: Siegfried and Kriemhild
The story begins at the Burgundian court, where Kriemhild, the sister of King Gunther and his brothers, has a dream. She sees a falcon being attacked by two eagles - a dream that is interpreted as a prophecy that her future husband will suffer a violent death. This leads Kriemhild to decide to remain single.
Siegfried, the crown prince of Xanten, is then introduced. He is a heroic figure, but the details of his exploits are initially limited. Later, Siegfried travels to Worms to woo Kriemhild. After his arrival, Hagen of Tronje, a vassal of King Gunther, recounts Siegfried's youthful adventures, including the winning of a treasure from Nibelung and Schilbung and his victorious battle against a dragon.
Siegfried's victory over the dragon makes him almost invulnerable, apart from a spot on his back where a lime leaf fell while he was bathing in the dragon's blood. Despite his impressive reputation, the Burgundians do not allow Siegfried to meet Kriemhild at first. However, Siegfried proves his loyalty by helping Gunther to fend off an invasion by the Saxons.
In the following chapters, Siegfried finally meets Kriemhild and allies himself with Gunther in order to win the hand of the Icelandic queen Brünhild. Siegfried agrees to help Gunther on the condition that he is allowed to marry Kriemhild in return. When they arrive in Iceland, they meet the powerful Brünhild, who challenges them to physical contests and threatens them with death if they lose. Siegfried uses his magical cloak, which gives him invisibility and extraordinary strength, to help Gunther to victory, which leads to Brünhild agreeing to marry Gunther.
In the following chapters, Siegfried conquers the Nibelung country and returns to Worms with Gunther and Brünhild. Siegfried and Kriemhild marry with Gunther's blessing. On their wedding night, Brünhild suspects that she has been betrayed. She uses her immense strength to resist Gunther, prompting Siegfried to intervene once more and overpower her. He secretly takes her ring and her belt, symbolizing her deflowering and hinting at a possible sexual encounter.
Years later, the jealous and suspicious Brünhild persuades Gunther to invite Siegfried and Kriemhild into her kingdom. An argument breaks out between Kriemhild and Brünhild over the hierarchy of their husbands, which leads to Kriemhild revealing the belt and the ring, indicating that Brünhild was once Siegfried's lover. This revelation shocks Brünhild and sparks tensions between the men.
To end the conflict and protect Gunther's honor, Hagen concocts a plan to murder Siegfried. Under the pretext of a false military threat, Hagen persuades Kriemhild to mark Siegfried's only weak spot on his back with a cross, supposedly to protect him. After the supposed threat is lifted, Hagen uses this information to kill Siegfried during a hunting trip.
Kriemhild later discovers Hagen's treachery when Siegfried's wound bleeds in Hagen's presence. As the story progresses, Hagen realizes that Kriemhild is gaining influence through her treasure and decides to steal it, laying the foundation for further conflict.
Part 2: Kriemhild's revenge
Kriemhild swears to seek revenge for the murder of her husband and the theft of her treasure. Years later, she receives a marriage proposal from Etzel, the king of the Huns, travels to the land of the Huns and marries him. To celebrate the baptism of her son, she invites her brothers, the Burgundians, to a feast at Etzel's castle in Hungary. Hagen does not want to go at first, as he suspects that it is a trick by Kriemhild to take revenge and kill them all. Nevertheless, he is mocked until he finally gives in.
As the Burgundians cross the Danube, mermaids confirm the bad fate and prophesy that all but one monk will die. Hagen tries to drown the monk to thwart the prophecy, but he survives.
On their arrival at Etzel's castle, the Burgundians are greeted by Kriemhild with a mendacious smile and apparent mercy. However, Dietrich von Bern, an ally of Etzel, advises the Burgundians to carry their weapons with them at all times for safety reasons, which is not permitted under normal circumstances. The tragedy takes its course when Kriemhild appears before Hagen, accuses him of the death of her husband Siegfried and demands the return of the Nibelung treasure. Hagen humiliates her further by openly carrying Siegfried's sword Balmung, which was stolen from his corpse, and admitting that he killed Siegfried and stole the Nibelung treasure. Hagen blames Kriemhild for his actions because of her own behavior.
King Etzel welcomes his wife's brothers with open arms. But outside the tense feast in the great hall, a battle breaks out between the Huns and the Burgundians. When news of the battle reaches the feast, Hagen beheads the young son of Kriemhild and Etzel right in front of them. Kriemhild offers to spare her brothers' lives if they hand over Hagen, but they refuse. The battle lasts all day until Kriemhild orders the hall to be burned, along with the Burgundians inside.
All the Burgundians are killed except Hagen and Gunther, who are bound and captured by Dietrich von Bern. Kriemhild has the men brought to her and orders her brother Gunther to be killed. Even after seeing Gunther's severed head, Hagen stubbornly refuses to reveal to Kriemhild what he has done with the Nibelung treasure. In her rage, Kriemhild herself cuts off Hagen's head. Old Hildebrand, mentor to Dietrich von Bern, is furious at the dishonorable demise of the Burgundian guests and hacks Kriemhild to pieces with his sword. A manuscript from the 15th century states that he strikes Kriemhild in the waist with a single clean blow; however, she feels no pain and declares that his sword is useless. Hildebrand then drops a ring and orders Kriemhild to pick it up. As she bends down, her body falls to pieces. Dietrich, Etzel and the entire court mourn the death of so many heroes.
