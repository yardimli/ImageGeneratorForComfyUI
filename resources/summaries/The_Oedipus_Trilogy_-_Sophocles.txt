The Oedipus Trilogy
Sophocles
The Oedipus Trilogy, also known as the Theban plays, is a collection of three tragedies by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, centered on the mythical king Oedipus and his family in the city-state of Thebes. While not a true trilogy in the modern sense, as they were written out of chronological order and explore different themes, the plays—*Oedipus Rex*, *Oedipus at Colonus*, and *Antigone*—form a complete narrative arc of a man's tragic struggle against fate. The story of Oedipus, a brilliant and powerful king who unknowingly fulfills a prophecy that he will murder his father and marry his mother, is a foundational work of Western literature, exploring profound questions of fate, free will, self-knowledge, and justice.

Summary
The story of *Oedipus Rex* opens in the city of Thebes, which is suffering from a devastating plague. The citizens appeal to their king, Oedipus, to save them, placing their trust in him as he had previously saved the city from the monstrous Sphinx by solving her riddle. For his heroism, the Thebans had made him their king, and he married Jocasta, the widow of the previous king, Laius, who had been mysteriously murdered. Together, Oedipus and Jocasta have four children.
Determined to help his people, Oedipus announces that he has already sent his brother-in-law, Creon, to the oracle of Apollo for guidance. Creon returns with a divine message: the plague will only end when the murderer of King Laius, who still lives unpunished within Thebes, is found and exiled. Oedipus vows to find the killer and bring him to justice, proclaiming a curse upon the murderer and anyone who harbors him.
On Creon's advice, Oedipus summons Tiresias, the blind prophet of Apollo. When Tiresias arrives, he is reluctant to speak, which infuriates Oedipus, who accuses the prophet of being involved in the murder. Angered by the accusation, Tiresias reveals the horrifying truth: Oedipus himself is the murderer of Laius and the cause of the plague. He further prophesies that Oedipus will soon discover his wife is also his mother, and that the mighty king will become a blind, exiled beggar. Oedipus dismisses the prophecy, mocking the prophet's physical blindness.
Oedipus then accuses Creon of conspiring with Tiresias to overthrow him. Creon calmly denies this, arguing he enjoys the privileges of royalty without the heavy responsibilities of being king. Jocasta intervenes, urging Oedipus to ignore prophecies. As proof, she tells him that an oracle once foretold that Laius would be killed by his own son, a prophecy she believes was thwarted because their infant son was abandoned on a hillside to die, his ankles bound together. She adds that Laius was killed by robbers at a place where three roads meet.
This detail unnerves Oedipus. Years ago, while fleeing his home in Corinth to escape a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother, he killed a man matching Laius's description at a similar crossroads. To clear his name, he sends for the sole survivor of the attack, a shepherd, hoping he will confirm that multiple robbers were responsible.
A messenger then arrives from Corinth with the news that Polybus, the man Oedipus believed to be his father, has died of natural causes. Oedipus and Jocasta are momentarily relieved, thinking the prophecy has been proven false. However, Oedipus still fears the part of the prophecy concerning his mother, Merope. The messenger, hoping to ease his mind, reveals that Polybus and Merope were not his biological parents. He explains that he was once a shepherd and was given a baby, found on a hillside with his ankles pierced, by another shepherd from Thebes. He then gave this baby—Oedipus—to the childless king and queen of Corinth.
Upon hearing this, Jocasta turns pale and begs Oedipus to stop his search for the truth. Oedipus, believing she is merely afraid he will discover he is of low birth, dismisses her pleas and insists on finding the other shepherd.
When the Theban shepherd arrives, he at first refuses to speak but, under threat, reveals the whole truth. The baby he gave to the Corinthian messenger was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Fearing the prophecy that the child would kill his father, Jocasta had ordered the shepherd to abandon the infant on the hillside. The shepherd, taking pity on the baby, gave him away instead. At last, Oedipus understands that he is the child from the prophecy and that he has fulfilled his horrific destiny.
Horrified, Oedipus rushes into the palace. A moment later, an official emerges to announce that Queen Jocasta has hanged herself. Oedipus, discovering her body, takes the golden brooches from her dress and plunges them into his own eyes, blinding himself. He staggers back out before his people, blood streaming from his eyes, accepting responsibility for his self-mutilation but blaming the god Apollo for his tragic fate. He says he blinded himself because he could not bear to look upon his children, his city, or face his parents in the underworld.
Creon takes control and, after Oedipus begs to be exiled, agrees to consult the gods before taking action. Creon promises to care for Oedipus's young daughters, Antigone and Ismene, and Oedipus is led away, a broken man. The Chorus closes the play by warning the citizens that no one can be considered happy until their life has ended, free from pain.
