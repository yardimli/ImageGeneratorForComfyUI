Summary
Set in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the submarine Nautilus, secretly built by its enigmatic commander, Captain Nemo.
A mysterious sea monster sinks the ships it encounters on its way. The few survivors of these events report large fluorescent reflections and a mass that moves at tremendous speed and hurls columns of water to great heights. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a famous naturalist from the Paris Museum of Natural History, who became famous after publishing a work on the underwater world, is called to take part in the expedition to rid the seas of the monster once and for all. Together with his faithful steward Conseil, he embarks on the Abraham Lincoln, the frigate equipped by the US Navy for this venture. On board, they make the acquaintance of the talented Canadian harpooner Ned Land.
After many months of unsuccessful sailing, during which Commander Farragut even considers abandoning the venture, the Abraham Lincoln finally encounters the notorious monster in Japanese waters. After a chase in which the beast displays astonishing speed, the crew of the frigate tries to throw a harpoon at it - without success. Attacked, the monster defends itself by targeting and ramming the Lincoln, destroying the rudder and tiller. The frigate can no longer be steered and drifts off.
The collision sends Aronnax and Conseil into the sea, where they are at the mercy of the waves and immersed in the fog for several hours. As death approaches, they hear the voice of Ned Land, who has also been thrown overboard, calling for help. They reach him after hearing the echo of his cries and see him standing on what appears to be a floating island. When the fog clears, the three castaways realize that the "island" is nothing more than the "monster", which is actually an underwater ship. Aronnax, Conseil and Ned Land are discovered by the ship's crew, taken on board and captured. On board, they meet the commander of the submarine Nautilus, the mysterious Captain Nemo.
Thus begins a long voyage full of unforeseen events and adventures, which prompts Jules Verne to write epic and fascinating descriptions. Wearing special suits, the three protagonists take part in a hunting trip, more precisely an excursion to the underwater forests of Crespo in the Pacific, during which they shoot a sea otter with a shot from a special electric rifle invented by Captain Nemo. Arriving in the Asian archipelago, they flee from a tribe of wild man-eaters. On their onward journey to the Indian seas, they make another underwater excursion, during which they visit a huge pearl kept by Captain Nemo in an equally large oyster. With the help of Ned Land, the latter saves a young pearl fisherman from a shark with a knife. The Nautilus crosses the Suez Canal before its official opening and dives through a tunnel discovered by Captain Nemo before reaching the Mediterranean.
Although Aronnax and Conseil are interested in scientific discoveries, Ned Land plans a night-time escape during the Atlantic crossing. However, Captain Nemo crosses Aronnax's path at the agreed time, so that the escape cannot take place, and together they go on an excursion during which Captain Nemo shows the professor the sunken remains of the continent of Atlantis.
The Nautilus continues its journey until it reaches the South Pole, where it almost becomes stranded in the ice. On the way back north, the submarine is besieged by giant squid, killing a crew member, and then saves some whales from a sperm whale attack.
Captain Nemo is a brilliant man, but at the same time dark and mysterious. He claims to have renounced human society and severed all ties with the mainland. Nevertheless, he helps the Greek autonomists by giving them the treasures he has found at the bottom of the sea. He also displays an implacable hatred for a particular ship whose "nation" he recognizes without seeing its flag, and sinks it violently to avenge his family, calling himself an oppressed man and leaving everything else a mystery.
Several times Land tries in vain to organize an escape plan, even against the will of Professor Aronnax himself, who is reluctant to leave the Nautilus because of the many beauties and discoveries for his studies of the marine world. After a few months, however, life on the submarine becomes monotonous: Captain Nemo becomes more and more introverted and the protagonists, including the professor, no longer feel the same initial enthusiasm. Ned Land seizes the opportunity to organize a new escape attempt with the Nautilus dinghy when the submarine is suddenly drawn into the terrible Malstrom whirlpool near the Norwegian coast. The three fugitives are thrown from the ship, lose consciousness due to the force of the sea and wake up safe and sound in a fishing hut on one of the Lofoten Islands, where they await their return to France.
