Summary
In 1942, Willy Loman, a 63-year-old traveling salesman, returns to his Brooklyn home, exhausted and unable to complete a business trip to New England. His wife, Linda, is alarmed and suggests he request a transfer to the New York office to stop traveling. Surrounded by towering apartment buildings that have replaced the trees he once loved, Willy drifts into nostalgic memories of 1928, a happier time. His two grown sons, Biff and Happy, are home for a visit but are a source of disappointment. Happy, 32, is a department store clerk who seduces his bosses' fianc√©es, while Biff, 34, once a high school football star, is unemployed and directionless. The brothers discuss buying a ranch out West, and Biff plans to ask a former employer, Bill Oliver, for a $10,000 loan, though he worries Oliver remembers him for stealing a carton of basketballs.
Alone, Willy slips into a vivid memory of his sons as teenagers. He praises young Biff for stealing a football, calling it "initiative," and scoffs at his studious neighbor, Bernard, insisting that being "well liked" is the key to success, not hard work. The memory shifts as Willy complains to Linda about their finances, lying about his sales before confessing that he isn't liked on the road and feels lonely. The sound of a woman's laughter pulls him into another memory: an affair he had in Boston with a secretary, Miss Francis, to whom he gave new stockings. This memory causes him to lash out in the present, angrily snatching a pair of mended stockings from Linda.
Agitated, Willy is visited by his neighbor Charley, who offers him a job out of concern. Willy's pride makes him refuse. Instead, he begins a frenzied conversation with his dead brother, Ben, a man who walked into the jungle and emerged rich with diamonds, personifying the success that has eluded Willy. After Willy wanders off, Linda reveals the family's dire situation to her sons: Willy is now working only on commission and has been borrowing $50 a week from Charley to feign a salary. More alarmingly, she has found a rubber hose attached to the gas pipe in the basement, revealing his suicide attempts. The news of Biff's plan to see Bill Oliver briefly lifts Willy's spirits, and he dreams of his sons starting a successful sporting goods line.
The next morning, Willy goes to his boss, Howard Wagner, to ask for a New York position. Howard, more interested in his new tape recorder, is unsympathetic and fires Willy. Devastated, Willy relives the moment Ben offered him a job in Alaska, a chance he turned down at Linda's urging for the false security of his sales job. Desperate, Willy visits Charley's office to borrow more money and encounters a now-successful Bernard, who is leaving to argue a case before the Supreme Court. Bernard asks what happened in Boston that made Biff give up on his life after failing his high school math exam, but Willy becomes defensive and refuses to answer.
That evening at Frank's Chop House, Biff tells Happy that his meeting was a disaster; Oliver didn't remember him and left him waiting for hours. In a moment of panic, Biff stole Oliver's fountain pen. The experience forces Biff to realize that his whole life, and his father's perception of it, has been a lie; he was never a salesman for Oliver, only a shipping clerk. When Willy arrives and confesses he's been fired, his mind fractures. He slips into the memory of the Boston hotel room, where a young Biff has arrived unexpectedly with news of his failed math class, only to discover his father with another woman. As Willy relives this devastating moment, Biff and Happy, unable to cope, abandon him at the restaurant. Willy, panic-stricken, gives the waiter all his money and rushes out, frantically asking where he can buy seeds to plant in his garden.
Later that night, Biff finds Willy outside planting seeds by flashlight, talking to the ghost of Ben about his $20,000 life insurance policy. Biff confronts his father, showing him the rubber hose and calling him a "phony." In an emotional climax, Biff breaks down sobbing in his father's arms, pleading with him to let go of his false dreams. Willy misinterprets Biff's tears as a sign of love and forgiveness. Believing his death will finally provide Biff with the money to be a success, Willy gets into his car and drives off, committing suicide.
At the funeral, only the family, Charley, and Bernard are present. Happy vows to stay in the city and succeed where his father failed. Biff recognizes that Willy had the wrong dreams but was a good man. Charley delivers a moving eulogy, explaining that a salesman must dream. Linda, confused as to why Willy would kill himself now that they've made the final mortgage payment, sobs over his grave, "We're free... We're free..."
