Animal Farm
George Orwell


"Animal Farm" by George Orwell is a timeless political masterpiece that takes the reader on a haunting journey through human nature and the mechanisms of power. The novella tells the story of the animals on Manor Farm who rise up against the oppression of their human owners to build a new society based on equality and justice. The novella is an allegory of the Soviet Revolution of 1917 and the emergence of Stalinist rule. By using animals as the main characters, Orwell creates a distance from reality and enables the reader to look at historical events with a fresh perspective.
Summary
At Manor Farm near Willingdon in England, the animals suffer from poor management and neglect by the unreliable and alcoholic farmer Mr. Jones. In this depressing situation, the respected wild boar Old Major holds a meeting one night. He calls on the animals to overthrow the human oppressors and teaches them a revolutionary song, "Beasts of England". After Old Major's death, two aspiring pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, lead the farm animals in a rebellion, driving out Mr. Jones and renaming the property "Animal Farm".
They proclaim the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the main one being "All animals are equal". This commandment is prominently displayed on the barn wall. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon teaches the puppies the principles of Animalism.
To mark the dawn of a new era on Animal Farm, Snowball hoists a green flag embellished with a white hoof and horn. The animals enjoy an abundance of food and the farm flourishes. The pigs take on leadership roles and set aside special foods for themselves, ostensibly for health reasons. After a failed attack by Mr. Jones and his cronies to retake the farm, Snowball unveils his ambitious plans to modernize the farm by building a windmill. Napoleon vehemently opposes this idea. Tensions escalate into a power struggle in which Napoleon's dogs chase Snowball away. Napoleon then declares himself the unrestricted leader of the farm.
Napoleon overhauls the organizational structure of the farm and abolishes the general gatherings of the animals. Instead, he introduces a committee of pigs to control the farm from now on. With the help of an eloquent young pig named Squealer, Napoleon takes credit for the idea of a windmill. The animals increase their work output in anticipation of a better life through the windmill.
When the windmill is destroyed after a heavy storm, Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is behind the act of sabotage. As a result, they start a purge in which animals accused of being Snowball's allies are removed from the farm. Napoleon takes the opportunity to further defame his old rival, even going so far as to portray Snowball as an accomplice of Mr. Jones. He denies that Snowball was decorated for his bravery and blatantly praises himself as the hero of the battle.
The hymn "Beasts of England" is replaced by "Animal Farm", which praises Napoleon, who gradually takes on human-like traits ("Comrade Napoleon"). Under his rule, another brutal purge takes place, in which numerous animals suspected of conspiring with Snowball are executed by Napoleon's dogs. This violence terrifies the remaining animals. Nevertheless, Napoleon manages to calm them down with the argument that they are better off now than under Mr. Jones' rule. The sheep's constantly repeated slogan, "four legs good, two legs bad", also helps to calm the unrest.
The neighboring farmer Mr. Frederick attacks the farm and destroys the rebuilt windmill with explosives. The animals successfully defend the farm, but suffer heavy losses, including injuries to the hard-working workhorse Boxer. Boxer recovers at first, but later collapses at work and is taken away in a cart that actually belongs to a horse slaughterer. Benjamin the donkey points out the butcher's sign, but Squealer appeases the animals by claiming that the cart was purchased from an animal clinic without changing the sign. Later, Boxer's death is announced and a feast is held in his honor, although in reality Napoleon sold Boxer to the butcher to raise money for whiskey.
Over time, the windmill is rebuilt and even an additional one is erected, bringing the farm a respectable income. However, the earlier ideals of electrically lit and heated stables are forgotten as Napoleon proclaims a simple life as happiness for the animals. Many of the original protagonists of the rebellion have either died or aged, including Snowball. Even Mr. Jones has since passed away in a home for drunkards.
The pigs begin to behave more and more like humans, walking upright, wearing clothes and drinking alcohol. The original commandments are condensed into a single phrase: "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." Additionally, the sheep's slogan is revised to "Four legs good, two legs better." The former symbolism of the farm is also discarded: The hoof-and-horn flag is replaced by a plain green banner, and the skull of the Old Major, which once served as a memorial, is buried.
A banquet is held by Napoleon to entertain both the pigs and the neighboring farmers, celebrating a new alliance between them. He abolishes the revolutionary rites and traditions and returns to the original name of the farm. A card game forms the highlight of the evening, with humans and pigs complimenting and cheating each other at the same time. A fight breaks out when Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, both play the ace of spades and argue loudly about who cheated first. The other animals watching the action from outside are horrified to realize that they can no longer tell the pigs from the humans.
