Summary
The story is set in Paris in 1482, during the reign of King Louis XI. It centers on Esmeralda, an attractive sixteen-year-old Roma dancer who attracts the attention of several men. These include Phoebus de Chateaupers, a captain, Pierre Gringoire, a poet, Quasimodo, the hunchbacked hunchback of Notre-Dame, and his guardian, the archdeacon Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his covetous desire for Esmeralda and his ecclesiastical duty. In a desperate attempt to win her over, he instructs Quasimodo to kidnap her. The attempt fails as Phoebus and his men arrest Quasimodo and rescue Esmeralda. Esmeralda falls in love with Phoebus.
Gringoire, who tries to help Esmeralda, is overpowered by Quasimodo and finds himself in the "Court of Miracles", a place inhabited by Roma. As he is a stranger, they want to hang him, but Esmeralda saves him from death by agreeing to take him as her husband for four years.
The following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be publicly flogged and then displayed in the pillory for an hour. Thirsty and tormented, he begs for water. Esmeralda sees his suffering and gives him a drink. This mercy touches Quasimodo deeply and he falls in love with the young woman who has helped him in his distress.
Frollo, plagued by jealousy, pursues Phoebus to an inn where he has planned a meeting with Esmeralda. There he observes how Phoebus ensnares Esmeralda and, in a fit of rage, stabs Phoebus to death. Esmeralda is then arrested and accused of attempted murder and witchcraft. She is sentenced to death and imprisoned, where she awaits execution. During her imprisonment, Frollo appears at her house and reveals his love for her. He offers to free her, but only if she returns his feelings. When Esmeralda realizes that Frollo is the real culprit who killed Phoebus, she angrily rejects him. However, her rejection does not prevent Frollo from continuing to desire her. When Esmeralda is taken to the gallows, Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre-Dame, comes to her rescue. With a dramatic gesture, he swings down and takes her to the cathedral, where she is safe for the time being, as the right of sanctuary grants her protection.
Frollo's obsession with Esmeralda becomes increasingly destructive and he is deeply frustrated that his plan to win her over is failing. During a meeting with Esmeralda and Quasimodo, his jealousy is ignited. Later that night, he breaks into Esmeralda's cell in the cathedral with the intention of having his way with her. However, Quasimodo notices the intruder in time and intervenes. He almost pushes Frollo from the cathedral before he realizes in the moonlight that the attacker is Frollo. Frollo then threatens Esmeralda and declares that if he can't have her, then no one can.
The situation comes to a head when Frollo informs Gringoire that the court has decided to revoke Esmeralda's right to protection in the cathedral and that she is now to be led to execution. Clopin Trouillefou, the leader of the Roma, hears of this decision from Gringoire and summons the inhabitants of the Court of Miracles to storm Notre-Dame and free Esmeralda.
However, Quasimodo misunderstands the Roma's intentions and believes they want to harm Esmeralda. He defends the cathedral against the attackers. The king is informed of the chaos and is mistakenly told that the attackers wanted to execute Esmeralda. He orders the authorities to disperse the crowd and orders Esmeralda's immediate execution to put an end to the unrest. In the midst of this turmoil, Frollo and Gringoire manage to abduct Esmeralda from the cathedral unnoticed.
Frollo makes another attempt to win Esmeralda's heart, but she remains steadfast and declares that she will never give him her love. The archdeacon takes Esmeralda to Sister Gudule, a nun who has withdrawn from the world and harbors a strong hatred of the Roma because she believes they have eaten her daughter. Surprisingly, it is revealed that Gudule is Esmeralda's real mother and that Esmeralda is the kidnapped child she thought was dead. However, their reunion is abruptly interrupted when the royal troops arrive to execute Esmeralda. In desperation, the mother clings to her daughter, but is brutally torn away, falling into the street and dying. Frollo and Quasimodo observe Esmeralda's execution from the tower of Notre-Dame. In his rage and despair, Quasimodo pushes Frollo off the cathedral, which also kills him. Quasimodo, who has now lost everything, withdraws and disappears without a trace.
In the epilogue, which takes place many years later, a deformed skeleton is discovered in the ossuary embracing another skeleton. The scene suggests that Quasimodo was looking for Esmeralda among the dead and died next to her while embracing her. As the authorities attempt to dismantle the skeletons, Quasimodo's skeleton crumbles to ashes as a silent testimony to a tragic and unrequited love.
