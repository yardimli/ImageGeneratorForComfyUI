The Merchant of Venice
William Shakespeare
"The Merchant of Venice" by William Shakespeare is a celebrated tragicomedy that intertwines the fates of its characters through themes of love, wealth, prejudice, and the conflict between justice and mercy. The play follows the story of a Venetian merchant who risks his life to finance his friend's courtship of a wealthy heiress. This act of friendship sets off a dramatic chain of events, culminating in a tense courtroom showdown where a cruel moneylender seeks a gruesome revenge, only to be outwitted by the resourceful heroine in disguise.

Summary
In Venice, the merchant Antonio is overcome with a melancholy he cannot explain. His friends suggest he is worried about his six merchant ships at sea, but he denies it. The likely cause of his sadness is the impending departure of his dearest friend, Bassanio, a young nobleman who, though debt-ridden, plans to travel to the distant estate of Belmont to win the hand of the beautiful and wealthy heiress, Portia. Bassanio asks Antonio for a loan to fund his journey, promising to repay it once he has secured Portia’s fortune. Antonio’s own funds are tied up in his sea ventures, but he agrees to act as guarantor for a loan from another source.

Meanwhile, at Belmont, Portia is equally unhappy. She is pursued by numerous suitors but is bound by her late father’s will to marry the one who can pass a specific test. Each suitor must choose from three caskets—one gold, one silver, and one lead. The one who chooses the casket containing Portia’s portrait wins her hand; an incorrect choice requires the suitor to leave immediately and vow never to marry. Portia despairs not only over this lack of choice but also because she finds her current suitors deeply flawed.

Back in Venice, Bassanio secures a loan from Shylock, a Jewish moneylender who harbors a profound hatred for Christians, and especially for Antonio, who has publicly insulted him and undermined his business by offering interest-free loans. When Antonio arrives to guarantee the loan, Shylock proposes a sinister bond: if the loan is not repaid in three months, Shylock will be entitled to take a pound of flesh from any part of Antonio’s body he chooses. Despite the danger, Antonio agrees to the terms.

As Bassanio prepares for his journey, his talkative friend Gratiano arranges to accompany him. In another part of Venice, Shylock’s daughter, Jessica, plans to elope with a young Christian named Lorenzo, taking with her a substantial amount of her father’s jewels and money.

At Belmont, the Prince of Morocco attempts the casket challenge. He chooses the golden casket, inscribed “Who chooseth me, shall gain what many men desire,” believing Portia is the object of worldwide desire. Inside, however, he finds only a skull and a poem reminding him, “All that glisters is not gold.” He departs in shame.

In Venice, Shylock is devastated by Jessica's flight, his sorrow mixing with rage over his stolen wealth. At the same time, rumors begin to circulate that some of Antonio’s ships have been lost at sea, placing his bond in jeopardy. Next to try his luck in Belmont is the Prince of Arragon. He selects the silver casket, which reads, “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.” He opens it to find the portrait of a “blinking idiot” and leaves humiliated. Just then, a messenger announces Bassanio’s arrival.

News continues to pour into Venice confirming the loss of all of Antonio's ships. Shylock rejoices in the merchant’s misfortune, eagerly anticipating the chance to "feed my revenge."

In Belmont, as Bassanio considers the caskets, Portia, who is already attracted to him, has a song played that subtly hints at the correct choice. Understanding that appearances can be deceiving, Bassanio bypasses the ornate gold and silver caskets. He chooses the humble lead one, which bears the inscription, “Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath.” Inside, he finds Portia’s portrait. Overjoyed, Portia agrees to marry him that day and gives him all her possessions. She places a golden ring on his finger, a symbol of their love, warning that if he ever loses or gives it away, their marriage will be over. Portia’s lady-in-waiting, Nerissa, and Gratiano announce that they will also marry, and Nerissa gives Gratiano a similar ring with the same condition. Their celebration is interrupted by Lorenzo and Jessica’s arrival, but the mood darkens when a messenger brings news of Antonio’s fate: all his ships are lost, and Shylock is intent on collecting his pound of flesh. Portia offers to pay the debt many times over and insists that Bassanio, once married, must rush back to Venice to save his friend.

In a Venetian court, the Duke presides over the case, trying to persuade Shylock to show mercy. But the moneylender is unyielding, demanding that the law be enforced exactly as written in the bond. Just as the Duke is about to grant Shylock his wish, Portia and Nerissa enter, disguised as a young doctor of law named Balthazar and his clerk. Balthazar urges Shylock to be merciful, but Shylock insists, “I crave the law.” Balthazar concedes that the bond is legal and Shylock is entitled to his pound of flesh from near Antonio's heart. As Antonio bravely prepares to die, Balthazar adds a crucial detail: the bond grants flesh, but makes no mention of blood. If Shylock sheds "one drop of Christian blood," all his lands and goods will be confiscated by the state. Realizing he is defeated, Shylock attempts to leave with just his money, but the court finds him guilty of attempting to take a citizen's life. His punishment is to forfeit his wealth, half to the state and half to Antonio. The state reduces its penalty to a fine, and Antonio stipulates that his half should go to Lorenzo and Jessica upon Shylock’s death, on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity.

A grateful Bassanio, not recognizing his disguised wife, offers Balthazar a reward. Balthazar declines payment but asks for Bassanio’s wedding ring, which Bassanio reluctantly gives up. Gratiano is similarly tricked by the "clerk" into giving away his ring.

Back in Belmont, Portia and Nerissa welcome their husbands home. They soon "discover" that the rings are missing and pretend to be furious, refusing to sleep with their husbands until the rings are returned. They tease them mercilessly, claiming they have slept with the men who now possess the rings. After the husbands express their shock and dismay, Portia reveals her deception, to the delight of all. She then gives Antonio a letter stating that three of his ships have returned safely to port and informs Lorenzo and Jessica of their future inheritance. The reunited couples then retire for their long-awaited wedding night.
