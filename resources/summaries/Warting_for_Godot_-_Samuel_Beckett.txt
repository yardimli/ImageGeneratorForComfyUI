Waiting for Godot
Samuel Beckett
"Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett is a tragicomedy in two acts and a seminal work of the Theater of the Absurd. The play dramatizes the experience of two tramps, Vladimir and Estragon, as they wait endlessly on a desolate country road for the arrival of a mysterious figure named Godot. Through their seemingly trivial conversations, vaudevillian routines, and encounters with other characters, the play explores profound themes of human suffering, perseverance, the futility of hope, the passage of time, and the search for meaning in a world where it may be absent. It challenges conventional dramatic structure, offering an experience of waiting itself rather than a traditional plot.
Summary
On a deserted country road, next to a single leafless tree, two tramps, Estragon (Gogo) and Vladimir (Didi), were waiting for a man named Mr. Godot. Estragon struggled to remove his boot while Vladimir fidgeted with his hat. They discussed their various afflictions and the Bible, with Vladimir pondering the conflicting Gospel accounts of the two thieves crucified with Christ, one of whom was saved. Estragon wanted to leave, but Vladimir reminded him they had an appointment with Godot. They contemplated hanging themselves from the tree but decided it was safer to wait.
Their wait was interrupted by the arrival of two strangers: Pozzo, a landowner, and his servant, Lucky, who was burdened with baggage and led by a rope around his neck. Pozzo drove Lucky with a whip, and upon seeing the tramps, he violently jerked the rope, causing Lucky to fall. Pozzo sat and ate chicken and wine, throwing the bones aside, which Estragon later gnawed on after Lucky refused them. Vladimir expressed outrage at Pozzo's cruel treatment of his servant. Pozzo explained he was on his way to the fair to sell Lucky. At the tramps' request, Pozzo made Lucky perform. Lucky first performed a clumsy dance called "The Net" and then, with his hat on, delivered a long, animated, but incoherent speech that parodied logical thinking. The tramps and Pozzo became so distressed by the speech that they tackled Lucky and removed his hat to silence him. After some confusion over his lost watch, Pozzo and Lucky departed.
Shortly after, a young Boy arrived with a message from Mr. Godot, stating that he would not come that evening but would surely come the next day. The Boy
revealed that he tended goats for Mr. Godot, who was kind to him but beat his brother, a shepherd. As night fell suddenly, Estragon and Vladimir again decided to leave, but they remained motionless.
The next evening, Vladimir waited alone at the same spot. The tree had mysteriously sprouted four or five leaves. Estragon appeared, barefoot and having forgotten most of the previous day's events, including their encounter with Pozzo and Lucky. The friends passed the time by contradicting each other, swapping their hats in a comical routine, and pretending to be Pozzo and Lucky. Suddenly, Pozzo and Lucky reappeared. This time, however, the rope connecting them was shorter, Pozzo was blind, and Lucky was mute. They immediately fell in a heap. After some hesitation and a comical attempt to help that resulted in both Vladimir and Estragon falling, they managed to help Pozzo to his feet. The blind Pozzo had no memory of their previous meeting and had lost all sense of time, proclaiming that birth is separated from death by only an instant. He and the mute Lucky then continued on their way.
Feeling lonely, Vladimir woke a dozing Estragon just as another Boy arrived, possibly the same one as before, though he denied recognizing Vladimir. He delivered the same message: Mr. Godot would not be coming that evening but would certainly arrive tomorrow. This time, the Boy added that Mr. Godot has a white beard. After the Boy ran off, the moon rose. Vladimir and Estragon once again contemplated hanging themselves, this time using Estragon's belt as a rope. The belt broke when they tested it, causing Estragon's trousers to fall around his ankles. They resolved to bring a better rope the next day. Estragon suggested they leave, and Vladimir agreed, but once again, they stood still as the play ended.
