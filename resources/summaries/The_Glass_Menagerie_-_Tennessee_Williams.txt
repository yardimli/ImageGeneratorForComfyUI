The Glass Menagerie
Tennessee Williams
"The Glass Menagerie" by Tennessee Williams is a renowned American "memory play" that explores the fragile lives of the Wingfield family in their cramped St. Louis apartment during the 1930s. The play delves into the conflict between the harshness of reality and the illusions the characters create to survive, a tension that comes to a head with the arrival of a long-awaited "gentleman caller." As a poignant study of family dysfunction, unfulfilled dreams, and the haunting power of memory, it stands as one of Williams's most celebrated and personal works.
Summary
Tom Wingfield, a would-be poet, appears on the fire escape of his family’s dingy St. Louis apartment in the present day, telling the audience he will narrate a play about his family from his memory. He transports the audience to the 1930s, a time he describes as when "the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind," oblivious to the looming global upheavals. The characters are his mother, Amanda; his crippled sister, Laura; a "gentleman caller"; and his father, a telephone company employee who "fell in love with long distances" and abandoned the family, appearing only as a photograph.
Tom enters the apartment for a dinner scene where his mother, Amanda, urges Laura to remain "fresh and pretty" for potential gentlemen callers. Amanda then drifts into a nostalgic reverie about her youth in Mississippi, claiming she once entertained seventeen gentlemen callers in a single afternoon. Tom is skeptical, and the dream is punctured when the shy Laura reminds her mother that no callers are currently expected.
A few days later, Laura is in the living room polishing her treasured collection of glass figurines—the "glass menagerie." She hastily hides them and pretends to study shorthand when she hears her mother approaching. A distressed Amanda enters, having discovered that Laura dropped out of her courses at Rubicam’s Business College after vomiting from nervousness during a test. Realizing Laura is too shy for a career, Amanda concludes that her daughter's only hope is marriage and becomes obsessed with finding her a husband. She begins selling subscriptions to a cheap women's magazine, Companion, to earn money to "properly feather the nest." Meanwhile, Tom grows increasingly miserable with his monotonous warehouse job at the Continental Shoemakers Company and his stifling home life. His frustration boils over into a bitter argument with Amanda, who accuses him of selfishness and lying about his nightly whereabouts (which he claims are "the movies"). In a rage, Tom threatens to leave and calls his mother an "ugly witch," then accidentally knocks over Laura’s glass collection while throwing his coat. A horrified Laura cries out, "My glass!—menagerie...." Ashamed, Tom kneels to pick up the pieces before storming out.
Tom stumbles home drunk at 5 a.m. and apologizes to Amanda for his behavior. He confesses his deep desire for "adventure," and Amanda, knowing she cannot hold him back forever, strikes a deal: he must find a suitable husband for Laura before he leaves. Though skeptical, Tom agrees to look for someone at the warehouse.
Later that spring, as a screen device in the play's text projects the word "ANNUNCIATION," Tom announces to his mother that he has invited a gentleman caller for dinner the next night. The man is Jim O’Connor, a coworker. Amanda is ecstatic and immediately begins making feverish plans, hoping he will be a good provider for Laura. Tom describes Jim as a good-natured young man who "goes in for self-improvement" and attends night school, but he tries to temper his mother's high expectations, warning her that Jim may not be attracted to Laura. Ignoring him, Amanda tells Laura to wish on the moon for "Happiness! Good Fortune!"
As narrator, Tom describes Jim as a former high school "hero"—a basketball star and president of the senior class and glee club—whose life in the six years since has been less successful. Tom recalls that Laura had a secret crush on Jim in high school but is unsure if Jim will remember her. Amanda frantically prepares for the visit, cleaning the apartment, buying a new rug, and dressing Laura up as a "pretty trap." Amanda herself puts on a dress from her youth, the one she wore to the governor's ball. When Laura learns that the caller is Jim O’Connor, she is stunned with fear.
Tom and Jim arrive, and a terrified Laura flees the room after a brief introduction. Tom informs Jim that he has joined the merchant marines and will soon be leaving home. Amanda welcomes their guest with the flirtatious charm of a Southern belle. When dinner is served, Laura becomes faint and retreats to the living room, holding back sobs.
Suddenly, the lights go out. Tom confesses he used the money for the electric bill to pay for his seaman’s card. As Amanda makes Tom help her with the dishes, Jim takes a glass of wine to Laura in the living room. After a few nervous moments, Laura tells Jim she remembers him from high school, and he eventually recalls her, whom he nicknamed "Blue Roses" because her bout with "pleurosis" sounded like the flower's name. Laura remembers the "clumping" of her leg brace with painful embarrassment, but Jim says he never noticed it. He tells her she suffers from an "inferiority complex" and encourages her to believe in herself.
Encouraged by his warmth, Laura shows Jim her glass menagerie, pointing out a unicorn as her favorite. Jim coaxes her into a dance, and as they move around the room, they bump the table, knocking the unicorn over and breaking its horn. Uncharacteristically calm, Laura remarks that now the unicorn is "just like all the other horses" and seems "less freakish." Jim then tells Laura she is pretty and impulsively kisses her. Seeing her infatuation, he immediately regrets it and nervously offers her a Life Saver. He then explains that he is engaged to another woman, Betty. Devastated, Laura gathers her dignity and gives him the broken unicorn as a "souvenir."
Amanda enters with lemonade and is shocked to learn Jim must leave to meet his fiancée. After Jim thanks them and says goodbye to Tom, calling him "Shakespeare," both women are left crushed. Amanda turns on Tom, bitterly blaming him for not knowing Jim was engaged. Tom storms out of the apartment for the last time.
Pausing on the fire escape, Tom the narrator explains that he fled St. Louis soon after, traveling the world in search of adventure. Yet he has always felt "pursued by something"—the memory of his sister. He says, "Oh Laura, Laura, I tried to leave you behind me, but I am more faithful than I intended to be!" On stage, Laura blows out her candles, and Tom bids her a final, haunting good-bye as she withdraws into her dark, lonely world.
