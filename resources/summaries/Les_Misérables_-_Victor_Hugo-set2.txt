Summary
The story describes French society from the Napoleonic era to the reign of the Citizen King Louis Philippe and covers the period from 1815 to 1832. At the center of the story is Jean Valjean, a former convict. After 19 years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread and four escape attempts, he is stigmatized by society and inwardly hardened. However, his life changes radically after an encounter with the Bishop of Digne, M. Myriel, a very kind-hearted priest who shows him kindness. After a short-lived and quickly repented theft from the little Savoyard Gervais, Valjean changes and develops into a person of moral integrity. Under the name M. Madeleine, he works his way up to education, wealth and prestige, becoming mayor and factory owner in Montreuil.
Fantine, an impoverished young grisette, also finds work in Madeleine's factory. She has been abandoned by her lover, the student Félix Tholomyès. To avoid being accused of immorality, she places her little daughter Cosette in the care of the greedy innkeeper Thénardier and works hard in Montreuil-sur-Mer to pay his ever-increasing demands for money. When it becomes known that she has an illegitimate child, she is dismissed from the factory. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and teeth and turns to prostitution. After an attack by a man, she is mistakenly arrested by Inspector Javert, a police informer. During her interrogation, she is rescued by Jean Valjean, who realizes that she is suffering from pneumonia and takes her to hospital. Valjean gives Fantine his word that he will bring her daughter Cosette back to her.
When an innocent man named Champmathieu is falsely accused of being the ex-convict Jean Valjean who has gone into hiding, Valjean reveals his true identity and loses everything he has built up. Fantine dies of shock when Valjean is arrested by Inspector Javert at the bedside. Valjean later manages to escape from custody on the ship Orion in Toulon by faking his death. From then on, he devotes his life to his fatherly love for Cosette, whom he rescues from the clutches of the Thénardiers. They live happily in hiding for a long time in Paris, where Valjean acts as a well-known benefactor under the assumed name of Fauchelevent.
The third part of the story introduces the revolutionary student Marius Pon-tmercy. He is raised by his conservative grandfather and studies law. After he learns more about his father, a former Napoleonic general, he develops a deep admiration for him. His father has left Marius a letter in which he instructs him to do everything possible for Thénardier, who supposedly saved him at the Battle of Waterloo. In fact, however, Thénardier had robbed Marius' father. After a political dispute, Marius leaves his grandfather's house. He moves close to the Thénardiers without knowing their identity. Marius falls in love with Cosette, whom he sees on regular walks in the Luxembourg garden, but without knowing where she lives. Éponine, the Thénardiers' elder daughter, who is secretly in love with Marius, gives him Cosette's address in Rue Plumet. Marius then writes Cosette a long love letter and the two meet regularly in the garden of this house, without Valjean finding out at first.
When Thénardier finds out where Valjean lives, he decides to rob him together with his gang. The attempt fails, however, as Javert rescues Valjean without realizing who he has actually saved. Valjean then flees from Javert. Valjean realizes that Thénardier is still stalking him and, in the politically tense atmosphere, also sees the danger of being exposed by the increasingly vigilant police. For these reasons, he plans to flee to England with Cosette.
Marius, who no longer sees any meaning in life without Cosette, joins his friends, the members of the Friends of the ABC organized in a club, in the Parisian June Uprising of 1832. He fights on the barricades in the hope of dying there. Although he is wounded, Valjean saves him out of love for Cosette by carrying him through the sewers without Marius being aware of it, as he is unconscious. During the revolution, Valjean also saves the police informer Javert, whose world view is so shaken by this act that he commits suicide. Gavroche, a street urchin who had joined the revolutionaries, and Éponine, who saves Marius by taking a bullet for him, are also killed during the uprising. Enjolras, the leader of the revolutionaries, is finally shot together with Grantaire, a student revolutionary, who was drunk throughout the battle.
After the failure of the revolution, Marius is cared for in the house of his grandfather, who, despite everything, truly loves him. After his recovery, Marius immediately marries Cosette. After the wedding, Jean Valjean reveals his past as a former convict to his son-in-law Marius, whereupon Marius keeps him away from Cosette, causing Valjean to fall ill out of grief. However, when Marius realizes Valjean's true merits - ironically through an attempt at blackmail by Thénardier, who wants to defame Valjean and extort money for his trip to America - he seeks his forgiveness. Marius and Cosette reach Valjean just in time to see him on his deathbed. They ask the dying man for forgiveness. He embraces them like his children and dies in their arms. In the end, Valjean's body is buried in a cemetery for the poor.
