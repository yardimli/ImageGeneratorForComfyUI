Summary
An enigmatic individual named Griffin, known as "the stranger", appears in the midst of a snowstorm in the English village of Iping, West Sussex, and takes up residence at Mr. and Mrs. Hall's inn. Clad in a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves, with his face concealed by bandages except for a prosthetic nose, his appearance is shrouded in mystery. His demeanor is withdrawn, irritable and unfriendly, and he demands to be left alone. He spends his days in his room experimenting with chemicals and laboratory equipment and only leaves the house at night.
The stranger causes several accidents at the inn, and when Mrs. Hall calls him on it, he reacts angrily and demands that the cost of the damage be put on his bill. During his stay, hundreds of strange glass bottles are delivered, leading to rumors and speculation in the village.
At the same time, a mysterious burglary occurs in the village. Griffin finds himself short of money and looks for ways to pay his bills. After a confrontation with his landlady, he reveals in a fit of rage that he is invisible. When policeman Jaffers tries to arrest him, Griffin escapes by shedding his clothes and using his invisibility to flee.
Griffin meets a tramp named Thomas Marvel and forces him to become his sidekick. Together they return to the village to retrieve Griffin's notebooks. Marvel tries to betray the Invisible Man, who then threatens him with death. Marvel flees to Port Burdock, where he is pursued by the Invisible Man until he is shot dead by a bar patron in an inn.
The Invisible Man finds refuge in the house of Dr. Kemp, an old acquaintance from his time as a medical student. Here he reveals his true identity: He is an albino and former medical doctor who has turned to research in the field of optics.
He reveals to Kemp his discovery of a method for producing invisibility, which he first tested on a cat and then on himself. He tells of the fire he set to destroy evidence, his attempt to survive undetected in society, the theft of costumes from a theater store, and his journey to Iping to find a way to return to a visible state. He confesses that the events have affected his mental state and reveals a plan to use his invisibility to terrorize the nation.
Kemp, who has secretly alerted the local authorities led by Colonel Adye, Port Burdock's police chief, listens to Griffin's plan while waiting for backup. When Adye and his men arrive, Griffin manages to escape, but not before threatening that Kemp will be the first victim of his "Reign of Terror".
Kemp remains calm and tries to set a trap for the Invisible Man by using himself as a decoy. However, his plan is thwarted when a note he has sent is stolen by Griffin. During the ensuing pursuit, the Invisible Griffin arms himself with an iron bar and kills an innocent bystander.
Griffin manages to shoot Adye before entering Kemp's house. Adye's guards stop him, however, and Kemp escapes into the town, where the inhabitants rush to his aid. Griffin, still determined to kill Kemp, tries to strangle the doctor, but is surrounded by the angry crowd, grabbed and brutally beaten as he desperately pleads for mercy. Kemp, though attacked by Griffin, urges the crowd to back off and tries to save the Invisible Man's life to no avail. Grif-fin's battered body gradually becomes visible as he dies, a mournful figure in the silence of death. A local police officer demands that Griffin's face be covered with a cloth.
The epilogue reveals that Marvel, the tramp, has secretly kept Griffin's notebooks. With the stolen money, he has risen to become a successful businessman and now runs the "Invisible Man Inn". In the moments when he is not busy running his inn, Marvel tries to decipher the notes in the hope of one day reproducing Griffin's work. But with several pages accidentally destroyed during the hunt for Griffin, and the remaining notes encoded in Greek and Latin, with Marvel not even understanding the basic mathematical symbols, he is completely unable to grasp their meaning.
