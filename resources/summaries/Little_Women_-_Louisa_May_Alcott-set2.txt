Summary
Part One
Four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy - live together with their mother, whom they affectionately call Marmee, in modest circumstances in a neighborhood in Massachusetts. The family's father has lost his fortune and is serving as a chaplain in the American Civil War, far away from his family. The first Christmas without him is just around the corner.
At their mother's request, the girls donate their Christmas breakfast to a needy family. In return, their wealthy neighbor, Mr. Laurence, surprises them with a sumptuous feast. This gesture brings the two families closer together.
Two of the sisters, Meg and Jo, work to support the family. Meg teaches four children in a neighboring family, while Jo helps her wealthy great-aunt March in Plumfield. Beth, who is very shy, helps at home, and young Amy attends school.
The sisters are all different: Meg is beautiful and oriented towards traditional values, Jo is spirited and has a passion for writing, Beth is gentle and musically gifted, and Amy aspires to fine society and artistic elegance. They all strive to overcome their weaknesses: Meg's vanity, Jo's irascibility, Beth's excessive shyness, and Amy's materialism. The neighbor boy Laurie, Mr. Laurence's grandson and orphan, quickly befriends the sisters, and lively Jo in particular finds him a close friend.
As the war continues, the girls are busy with their own lives and aspirations. Jo publishes a novel but feels frustrated by the changes needed and the opinions of the critics. Meg, on the other hand, spends two weeks with rich friends where she attends dance parties and hones her social talents. Laurie is also invited to one of the dances, and rumors start that Meg is in love with him. But Meg's heart beats for John Brooke, Laurie's tutor.
Simultaneously, news arrives that Mr. March is suffering from pneumonia. Marmee has to rush to Washington to care for him. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany him, but Marmee refuses in order to spare him the hardships of the journey. Instead, John Brooke is sent, who confesses his love for Meg during the stay. Her parents are delighted, but they consider Meg too young to marry. Brooke agrees to wait patiently.
Tragically, while Marmee is away, Beth falls ill with scarlet fever after staying with a poor family who have lost three children. As a precaution, Amy is sent to stay with Aunt March, and Jo, who has had scarlet fever before, stays with Beth. Beth's condition worsens so much that Marmee is called back. Beth recovers, but never fully heals.
Brooke, who is waiting for Meg to marry him, signs up for military service and is wounded in the war. After his recovery, he looks for a job so that he can buy a home for himself and Meg. Laurie begins his studies at college. And finally, exactly one year after the story begins, the girls' father returns home to celebrate Christmas with his family.
Part two
Three years after the events in the previous section, Meg and John get married. They set out to discover life as a married couple, and Meg becomes the mother of twins. While she devotes herself to her children, John feels neglected. Meg seeks Marmee's advice, and together they find a balance between the needs of the family and the marriage, with Meg devoting more time to her husband and John becoming more involved in raising the children.
Meanwhile, Laurie successfully graduates from college, inspired by Jo's encouragement to try extra hard in his senior year. Amy is given the opportunity to travel to Europe with her aunt instead of Jo. Beth's health is weakened by the scarlet fever and she shows signs of dejection. As Jo tries to get to the bottom of Beth's sadness, she discovers that Laurie has fallen in love with her. Jo realizes that she doesn't love Laurie in the same way and shares her feelings with her mother.
Hoping to put distance between herself and Laurie and give him a chance to get over his feelings, Jo decides to seek adventure for a while. She moves in with a friend of her mother's in New York City for six months, where she works as a governess for two children. During this time, Jo also takes German lessons with a roommate, Professor Friedrich Bhaer, a Berliner who takes care of his sister's orphans. To earn some money, Jo begins to anonymously write spicy love stories for boulevard newspapers.
Friedrich rebukes her for this, as he considers this kind of writing to be unprincipled and reprehensible. Jo, influenced by his words, decides to give up this work, unaware that Frederick is in love with her. On her return to Massachusetts, Jo receives a proposal of marriage from Laurie, which she rejects.
To get over his unrequited love, Laurie travels to Europe with his grandfather. At home, Beth's health has deteriorated further and Jo devotes herself entirely to caring for her beloved sister. In Europe, Laurie meets Amy, and gradually a love develops between them, fueled by Amy's encouragement that he should take on something meaningful in life. After Beth's death, Laurie and Amy grow closer, and they eventually marry before returning from Europe.
Meanwhile, Frederick, who is in Massachusetts on business, asks Jo to marry him, which she accepts. As Friedrich is not financially well off, the wedding has to wait until he can earn money in the West. After a year without much success, Jo inherits the large Plumfield estate from the deceased Aunt March. She marries Friedrich and together they turn the house into a school. Jo and Friedrich have two sons, while Amy and Laurie have a daughter. In the end, the family gathers to celebrate Marmee's 60th birthday at Plumfield, surrounded by three daughters, their husbands and five grandchildren.
