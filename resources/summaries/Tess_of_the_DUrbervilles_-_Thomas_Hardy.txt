Tess of the D’Urbervilles
Thomas Hardy
Thomas Hardy's "Tess of the D'Urbervilles" is a powerful and tragic realistic novel that chronicles the life of a simple country girl whose fate is shaped by coincidence, social injustice, and the conflicting forces of nature and society. The story follows Tess Durbeyfield, who, after being deserted by her husband for a past transgression and exploited by a relentless seducer, is ultimately driven to murder and execution. Hardy's novel is a profound critique of Victorian morality and a portrayal of a human struggling alone against an indifferent universe, exploring timeless themes of love, fate, and the clash between the individual and society's arbitrary rules.

Summary
The story begins when John Durbeyfield, a poor peddler, is told by a local parson that he is descended from the noble D’Urbervilles, an ancient and powerful family. Thrilled by the news, John celebrates by getting drunk. That evening, at a May Day dance, his sixteen-year-old daughter, Tess, is noticed by a young, well-educated stranger named Angel Clare, though he does not dance with her. Soon after, the family’s horse, Prince, is killed in a tragic accident while Tess is driving the carriage to market, and she is consumed with guilt over the family’s resulting financial hardship. Her mother, Joan, learns of a wealthy family named D’Urberville living in nearby Trantridge and sends Tess to work for them, hoping to secure a favourable marriage. There, Tess meets the family’s son, Alec D’Urberville, an insistent and coarse young man who is immediately attracted to her. Alec arranges a job for her on the farm and, during her ride home to gather her belongings, gives her a rose that pricks her chin and draws blood.
A few days later, Alec relentlessly pursues Tess. Though she repeatedly resists him, one night she becomes lost and exhausted in the woods and accepts a ride from him. He takes a detour through The Chase, his family’s ancient hunting ground, where he seduces or rapes her. The following October, Tess, now pregnant, leaves Trantridge. Alec meets her on the road, but she refuses to return with him. Back home, she gives birth to a son whom she names Sorrow. When the infant falls gravely ill, Tess baptizes him herself. After the child dies, the local vicar refuses him a Christian burial, forcing Tess to bury him in an unconsecrated part of the churchyard. A year and a half later, seeking a fresh start, Tess takes a job as a dairymaid at Talbothays Dairy.
At Talbothays, Tess begins to feel hopeful again, making friends with the other dairymaids, Izz, Retty, and Marian. She is reunited with Angel Clare, who is now an apprentice farmer after rejecting his family's wish for him to become a clergyman. Tess and Angel are powerfully drawn to each other, though the other dairymaids are also in love with him. Troubled by her past, Tess is hesitant, but she cannot deny her feelings when Angel declares his love for her.
Angel’s parents reluctantly give him permission to marry Tess, though they would have preferred he marry the pious Mercy Chant. When Angel proposes, Tess initially refuses, citing their different backgrounds, and struggles to tell him her secret. She eventually agrees to marry him at New Year's. She tries to confess by slipping a letter under his door, but on their wedding day, she discovers that it slipped under the carpet and was never read. After the wedding, ominous signs appear: a cock crows in the middle of the day, and they learn that Retty has attempted suicide, Marian has gotten drunk, and Izz is deeply depressed over Angel. That night, encouraged by Angel's own confession of a past affair, Tess finally tells him her story.
Tess is shocked when Angel rejects her, claiming she is now "another woman" in his eyes. He sees her past as fundamentally different from his own and declares he cannot live with her while the other man is alive. One night, while sleepwalking, he tenderly carries Tess to an old abbey church and lays her in an empty stone coffin, as if burying her. They soon part ways, with Angel giving Tess money and promising to write before leaving for Brazil to look for farmland. On his way, he meets Izz and impulsively asks her to accompany him, but he withdraws the offer when she states that she could never love him more than Tess does.
Tess works several hard jobs, at one point putting wounded game birds out of their misery. She eventually joins Marian at a bleak farm called Flintcomb-Ash, where the employer knows her past and treats her harshly. After hearing of Angel's offer to Izz, Tess feels she cannot write to him. Anxious, she walks to his parents' home to ask for help, but she overhears his brothers speaking poorly of him and his marriage and returns disheartened. There, she is stunned to encounter Alec D’Urberville, who has become an itinerant preacher.
Claiming to have reformed, Alec pursues Tess again, begging her to marry him. She tells him she is already married and pleads with him to leave her alone. He persists, causing Tess to write a desperate letter to Angel, asking him to come home. In Brazil, Angel has suffered great hardship and has begun to regret his treatment of Tess. Alec abandons his preaching to follow Tess to her home village of Marlott after her father dies and the family is evicted. He offers to help them, but Tess continues to resist until the family, homeless, is forced to take temporary shelter in the D'Urberville family vault at a church. Burdened by responsibility and her family’s plight, Tess finally succumbs to Alec. She writes a bitter, accusing letter to Angel, warning him that it is too late.
Angel finally returns to England and finds Tess's angry letter waiting for him. He tracks her to the seaside town of Sandbourne, where he finds her living in a boarding house as Alec’s mistress. After Angel leaves, heartbroken, Tess confronts Alec and stabs him to death. The landlady discovers the body when she sees blood dripping through the ceiling. Tess rushes to find Angel, telling him what she has done. Overcome with compassion, Angel promises to protect her. They spend a few blissful days together in hiding in a deserted mansion. They eventually make their way to Stonehenge, where Tess, exhausted, falls asleep on an ancient stone altar. As she sleeps, officers arrive to arrest her. Awakening, Tess calmly says, “I am ready.” Some time later, Angel and Tess’s younger sister, ’Liza-Lu, stand on a hill and watch as a black flag is raised over the prison, signaling her execution. Bowed for a long time, they finally join hands and walk away together.
