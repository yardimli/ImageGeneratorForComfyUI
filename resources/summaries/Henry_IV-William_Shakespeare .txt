Henry IV, Part 1
William Shakespeare

"Henry IV, Part 1" is a masterful historical drama by William Shakespeare that chronicles the journey of a debauched young prince who must prove his worth to save his father's kingdom from rebellion. The play contrasts the rowdy, tavern-dwelling life of Prince Hal and his charismatic companion, Sir John Falstaff, with the solemn duties of the court and the fiery ambition of the rebel warrior Hotspur. As King Henry IV struggles to maintain his tenuous grip on the throne, the play explores enduring themes of honor, leadership, family duty, and the difference between appearance and reality, culminating in Prince Hal's dramatic transformation from a carefree youth into a noble heir.

Summary
The play opens with King Henry IV, weary from the civil war that brought him to power a year earlier by deposing and murdering King Richard II. His plan to lead a Crusade to the Holy Land to atone for his sins is immediately postponed by news of rebellion. In Wales, a thousand of his men have been killed, and Edmund Mortimer, a claimant to the throne, has been captured by the Welsh rebel Owen Glendower. The king is pleased, however, to learn that the young Harry Percy, known as Hotspur, has defeated the Scots and taken many prisoners. Henry openly wishes the honorable Hotspur were his son instead of his own, the decadent Prince Hal. The king's mood sours when he learns Hotspur intends to keep the prisoners for ransom, a defiance he attributes to Hotspur's uncle, the Earl of Worcester, who despises the king.
Meanwhile, Prince Hal spends his time in a London tavern, drinking with the fat, aging knight and professional thief, Sir John Falstaff. Their companion, Ned Poins, proposes a prank: Falstaff and his cronies will rob a group of pilgrims, after which the disguised Hal and Poins will rob the thieves. The humor, Poins explains, will be in hearing the cowardly Falstaff's lies about the incident. Alone, Hal delivers a soliloquy revealing his actions are a calculated performance; he is deliberately cultivating a dissolute reputation so that when he finally reveals his true, courageous nature, his reformation will seem all the more dazzling.
Back at court, an angry King Henry orders Hotspur to surrender his prisoners and refuses to ransom Mortimer, whom he considers a traitor for marrying Glendower's daughter. After the king leaves, Hotspur, his father Northumberland, and Worcester plot to overthrow him. They will join forces with Mortimer, Glendower, and Hotspur's former enemy, the Scot Douglas, to crush King Henry.
Near Rochester, Falstaff and his men rob the pilgrims, only to be immediately set upon by the masked Hal and Poins. Falstaff and the others drop the loot and flee in terror. Later at the Boar’s Head Tavern, Falstaff boasts of his bravery, claiming he fought off a dozen attackers at Gad's Hill. After letting him spin his tale, Hal exposes him as a coward and a liar. Unfazed, Falstaff claims he only fled because he recognized the prince and did not want to harm the heir to the throne. Their merriment is cut short by a messenger from the court bringing news of the rebellion. Anticipating a lecture from the king, Hal and Falstaff rehearse the scene, with Falstaff playing the king and praising his own influence on the prince. When they switch roles, Hal, as the king, compares Falstaff to the devil. Falstaff urges the prince to banish the other robbers but keep him; Hal's ominous reply, "I do, I will," foreshadows his future actions.
The main rebels—Mortimer, Glendower, Worcester, and the hot-headed Hotspur—meet to plan their division of the kingdom, but their arguments over territory reveal a lack of unity. At the palace, King Henry reprimands Prince Hal, who vows to prove his worth by defeating Hotspur in battle. Back at the tavern, Hal reports that he has repaid the stolen money and that his companions must now help defend the realm, giving Falstaff command of a company of foot soldiers.
At the rebel camp in Shrewsbury, Hotspur learns that his father is ill and cannot join them, and that Glendower will not arrive for two weeks. Despite these setbacks and the counsel of more experienced leaders, the impulsive Hotspur insists they attack the king's forces at once. Sir Walter Blunt arrives from the king with an offer of peace, and Hotspur agrees to send a representative to discuss it.
The king’s forces are ready for battle, but Henry hopes the rebels will accept his peace offer. Prince Hal even offers to fight Hotspur in single combat to decide the outcome. However, Worcester, fearing that the king would forgive the youthful Hotspur but punish him for the rebellion, decides to lie. He returns to the rebel camp and tells Hotspur that the king has arrogantly threatened them. Enraged, Hotspur is incited to battle, seeking Prince Hal's blood.
In the ensuing combat, the Scottish warrior Douglas kills Sir Walter Blunt, mistaking him for the king, as many royal soldiers are dressed in the king's likeness as a disguise. Falstaff enters, fleeing the battle, and is met by Hal, who asks to borrow his sword. Falstaff offers a bottle of liquor instead, which the newly dutiful Hal rejects. Soon after, the king is attacked by Douglas, but Hal returns and saves his father’s life. Douglas then attacks Falstaff, who falls and pretends to be dead. The long-awaited confrontation between Prince Hal and Hotspur finally occurs, ending when Hal fatally wounds Hotspur. Hal delivers a gallant farewell, covering his rival's face with the plumes from his own helmet. Seeing Falstaff's body, he briefly mourns his loss. As Hal exits, Falstaff rises and stabs Hotspur’s leg to ensure he is dead. When Hal returns with his brother, Prince John, Falstaff outrageously claims that he killed Hotspur. Amused, Hal allows him to take the credit.
The king’s forces win the battle. Henry sentences Worcester to death for causing so much bloodshed, but allows the courageous Douglas to go free. As the play ends, the king divides his forces to conquer the remaining rebels, celebrating both the restoration of peace and the revelation of Prince Hal’s noble character.
