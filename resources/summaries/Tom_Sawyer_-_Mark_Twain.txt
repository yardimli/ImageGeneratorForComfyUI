Tom Sawyer
Mark Twain
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" by Mark Twain is a celebrated novel that captures the essence of boyhood adventure in a Mississippi River town during the 1840s. The story follows the imaginative and mischievous Tom Sawyer as he navigates the worlds of school, church, and puppy love, often rebelling against the constraints of adult society. Alongside his friend, the outcast Huckleberry Finn, Tom's pranks and games lead them into a dangerous reality involving a murder, a tense courtroom trial, and a thrilling hunt for buried treasure, creating a timeless tale of friendship, conscience, and the journey from childhood innocence to a more mature understanding of the world.

Summary
The story begins in the small, shabby village of St. Petersburg, where Tom Sawyer lives with his kindly but gullible guardian, Aunt Polly, and his goody-goody half-brother, Sid. After being caught playing hooky to go swimming, Tom is sentenced to the dreary task of whitewashing a fence on a Saturday. However, through clever pretense, he makes the chore seem like a great privilege, convincing his friends to trade their most prized possessions—from a kite to a dead rat—for a chance to paint. Tom relaxes in the shade, amassing a small fortune in treasures while the fence is quickly completed. Later, he becomes infatuated with a new girl in town, a "lovely little blue-eyed creature" named Becky Thatcher, and spends the afternoon showing off for her.

The next day in Sunday school, which Tom loathes for its restraints, he is determined to impress Becky. When the superintendent offers a Bible prize to any student who has memorized enough scriptural quotations to earn a number of tickets, Tom, who has traded for his tickets, brazenly presents himself. His triumph is short-lived when, questioned by the esteemed Judge Thatcher, Becky’s father, he mistakenly names David and Goliath as the first two disciples.

On Monday, after a failed attempt to fake an illness to avoid school, Tom meets Huckleberry Finn, the son of the town drunkard. Envied by all the boys for his freedom and filth, Huck is a pariah to their mothers. The two make plans to meet in the graveyard at midnight with a dead cat to test a cure for warts. At school, Tom gets "engaged" to Becky with a kiss, but their bliss ends when he accidentally reveals a previous engagement to Amy Lawrence. A heartbroken Becky rejects him, and Tom resolves to run away and become a pirate.

That night in the graveyard, Tom and Huck witness a horrifying scene. They see the town drunkard Muff Potter, the villainous Injun Joe, and the young Dr. Robinson robbing a grave. An argument over money erupts, and in the ensuing fight, Injun Joe stabs the doctor to death with Potter's knife. He then frames the drunken Potter, convincing him that he committed the murder in a stupor. The two boys flee in terror and swear a blood oath never to reveal what they saw, fearing Injun Joe’s vengeance. The next day, Potter is arrested, and the boys are tormented by their guilty consciences, smuggling small comforts to the prisoner.

Feeling dejected by his guilt and Becky's continued rejection, Tom enlists his friend Joe Harper and Huck to run away and become pirates. As the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main, the Red-Handed, and the Terror of the Seas, they steal food and row a raft to Jackson's Island on the Mississippi River. They revel in their freedom until they hear cannon shots from the village and realize the town believes they have drowned. Their initial triumph gives way to homesickness. That night, Tom secretly returns to his home and hides under a bed, where he overhears Aunt Polly and Joe Harper's mother mourning them. Discovering that their funerals are planned for Sunday, he concocts a stupendous plan.

On Sunday, as the congregation sobs through the funeral service, Tom, Joe, and Huck march down the aisle, alive and well. Their return is a moment of glorious triumph. Tom attempts to make Becky jealous by flirting with Amy Lawrence, but his mood sours when he finds Aunt Polly angry, having learned from Mrs. Harper that his "dream" about the mourners was a lie. He soothes her by admitting he came back to kiss her and leave a note, which she later finds in his jacket pocket. At school, Becky accidentally rips a page in the schoolmaster's anatomy book. As the stern Mr. Dobbins questions each student, Tom sees Becky's terror and confesses to the crime himself, enduring a merciless flogging to save her. Their romance is rekindled. For the end-of-year ceremonies, the boys get their revenge on the increasingly severe schoolmaster by suspending a cat above his head, which snatches his wig to reveal a bald head they had previously painted gold.

As summer vacation begins, Tom's conscience over Muff Potter’s imprisonment worsens. During the trial, when it seems Potter will surely be convicted, Tom is called as a surprise witness for the defense. He tells the courtroom the truth, and as he does, Injun Joe leaps through a window and escapes. Tom is a hero, but he lives in fear of Injun Joe's return.

Soon, Tom and Huck are consumed with a new adventure: digging for hidden treasure. They investigate the town’s haunted house, where they see two men enter—one a stranger, the other a deaf-mute Spaniard they recognize as a disguised Injun Joe. The boys overhear him planning a "revenge" job and watch as the men unearth a box of gold coins worth thousands of dollars. The criminals take the treasure with them, planning to hide it at "Number Two—under the cross." The boys stake out a room at a local tavern, but find nothing.

Becky Thatcher returns to town and hosts a picnic for her schoolmates. The party takes a ferry to explore McDougal's Cave. That night, while Tom and Becky are in the cave, Huck follows the two men from the tavern. He overhears Injun Joe plotting to mutilate the Widow Douglas, who had been kind to him. Huck alerts Mr. Jones, the Welshman, who, with his sons, rushes to the widow’s house and scares off the attackers with gunfire. Huck falls ill with a fever and is cared for by the grateful Widow Douglas. Meanwhile, the town discovers with horror that Tom and Becky are missing, likely lost in the vast cave.

Inside the cave, Tom and Becky's candles burn out, leaving them in total darkness. Tom bravely explores the passages using a kite string to find his way back. During one such expedition, he sees a candle and a human hand—it belongs to Injun Joe. Three agonizing days later, Tom finds a small opening to the outside and they are rescued. Two weeks later, Judge Thatcher tells Tom he has had the cave entrance sealed with an iron door. Tom turns white and reveals that Injun Joe is inside. A party rushes to the cave and finds Injun Joe's body by the door, dead of starvation.

Relieved, Tom tells Huck that the treasure must be in the cave. They find the hidden entrance Tom discovered and, under a cross smoked on the wall, they unearth the strongbox filled with gold, along with some guns. They are interrupted by the Welshman and summoned to a party at the Widow Douglas's, where Huck is publicly revealed as the hero who saved her. The widow announces her intention to adopt Huck. At that moment, Tom declares that Huck doesn't need her charity because he's already rich, and reveals over twelve thousand dollars in gold, their shared treasure.

Huck's newfound wealth and life with the widow prove unbearable. Forced into clean clothes, table manners, and school, he finds the "shackles of civilization" imprisoning and runs away. Tom finds him and convinces him to return by promising that to be a respectable member of his new robber gang, one must have a respectable social standing. Huck agrees to stay with the "widder," and the story concludes, with the author noting that their adventures may be continued in a future book.
