Catch-22
Joseph Heller

"Catch-22" by Joseph Heller is a landmark satirical novel that captures the absurdity and madness of war. It follows Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Air Force bombardier in World War II, whose main goal is simply to survive. His desperate attempts to be declared insane to escape combat missions are constantly thwarted by the infamous and paradoxical military rule, "Catch-22," leading to a profound and darkly humorous exploration of bureaucracy, sanity, and rebellion.
Summary
In 1944, on the fictional Mediterranean island of Pianosa, Captain John Yossarian of the 256th Squadron is feigning a liver ailment in the hospital to avoid flying combat missions. He believes the military establishment is actively trying to kill him by forcing him into battle. His fear is compounded by the squadron's ambitious commander, Colonel Cathcart, who relentlessly raises the required number of missions for a tour of duty, making escape through service seem impossible. Yossarian seeks help from the flight surgeon, Doc Daneeka, who explains the inescapable logic of "Catch-22": a man can be grounded if he is crazy, but if he asks to be grounded, he is demonstrating a rational concern for his own safety and is therefore sane, and must continue to fly.
The base is populated by a cast of bizarre characters who embody the chaos of war. Yossarian's roommate, Orr, is a tinkerer who constantly crash-lands his plane. Milo Minderbinder, the mess officer, builds a massive black-market syndicate, M&M Enterprises, even contracting with the Germans to bomb his own base for a profit. Major Major Major, promoted by an IBM machine error, will only see people in his office when he is not there. The narrative, presented non-chronologically through Yossarian's memories, flashes back to key events that have shaped his paranoia. During the "Great Big Siege of Bologna," Yossarian tried to sabotage the mission. On a mission over Ferrara, he was a hero, but by the disastrous mission over Avignon, his nerve is gone. There, he witnesses the horrific death of his gunner, Snowden, whose insides spill out. This trauma leads Yossarian to walk around naked, and the memory of Snowden's quiet death convinces him that "man is garbage" once his spirit is gone.
As the number of required missions climbs from 45 to 70, Yossarian's friends are killed off one by one. The daredevil pilot McWatt accidentally kills Kid Sampson on the beach and then flies his plane into a mountain. Doc Daneeka, who was falsely listed on McWatt's flight log, is declared officially dead despite being alive and well on the ground. Nately, a young idealist in love with a Roman prostitute, is killed in action. Yossarian's attempts to rebel become more desperate. He goes AWOL to Rome to find Nately's missing whore, only to witness a city consumed by poverty and crime. He is arrested and brought before Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn, who offer him a deal: he can go home with an honorable discharge if he agrees to speak favorably about them.
Disgusted by the moral corruption of the deal, Yossarian is at a loss. As he recovers in the hospital from being stabbed by Nately's vengeful whore, he learns that his roommate Orr, who was presumed dead after his latest crash, has successfully paddled a life raft all the way to neutral Sweden. Yossarian realizes that Orr's constant tinkering and crashing were practice for his escape. Inspired by this act of rational rebellion against an insane system, Yossarian rejects the colonels' deal. He decides to desert the Air Force and make his own way to Sweden, taking responsibility for his own life. As he flees, he narrowly dodges one last attack from Nately's whore, running toward an uncertain but self-determined future.
