Summary
Marseille, 1815: the year of the Bourbon Restoration. Edmond Dantès is a young sailor on the merchant ship Pharao, about to be promoted to captain and marry his beloved fiancée Mercédès. Out of envy, Danglars, the ship's clerk and long-time candidate captain, sets a trap for Edmond in order to snatch the coveted promotion from him.
With the help of Fernand Mondego, Mercédès' cousin, who is openly in love with her even though she has rejected him, and Gaspard Caderousse, Dantès' jealous neighbor, Danglars writes an anonymous letter. In this letter, he denounces Edmond Dantès, falsely accusing him of being a Bonapartist agent. This letter ends up in the hands of Gérard de Villefort, the deputy public prosecutor and royal prosecutor. Villefort, who is anxious to be accepted into the wealthy, pro-monarchist family of the Marquis of Saint-Méran in order to marry his daughter Renée, while at the same time protecting his own father, an active Bonapartist, is particularly intransigent towards Dantès. Although he is aware of Dantès' innocence and the unfounded nature of the accusations, he nevertheless issues a warrant for his arrest.
The imprisonment
Edmond Dantès is arrested and taken at night to the prison known as the Château d'If, where he is sentenced to spend the rest of his life due to the seriousness of the crime he is accused of. Just as his hopes of returning to freedom are fading, he makes the acquaintance of another prisoner, Abbé Faria, who has been digging an underground tunnel for years in the hope that it might lead him out of the fortress.
Edmond decides to help the old man, who in turn helps Dantès to unravel the events that landed him in prison. Edmond realizes that he has been the victim of a conspiracy and vows to take revenge on all those who framed him. While he waits for his plan to come to fruition, he is tutored by Faria in various subjects, from economics to mathematics, from foreign languages to philosophy, until the old abbot is struck down by a series of strokes that lead to his death.
Before he dies, however, he reveals the exact location of a treasure hidden on the island of Monte Cristo, knowing full well that Dantès is good-natured. Dantès sees Faria's death as the only real chance of escape and takes his place in the sack in which the old man's body has been stowed. After being thrown into the sea, the "graveyard" of the Château d'If, Edmond Dantès manages to free himself from the sack and escape to the island of Tiboulen.
Revenge
After 14 years in captivity and the discovery of a priceless treasure that Faria had pointed out to him, Edmond Dantès returns to Marseille under the new identity of the Count of Monte Cristo to put his revenge plan into action. In Marseille, he takes on a number of different roles, including that of Abbot Busoni. As the abbot, he visits Caderousse, from whom he learns details about the plot, the death of his father, the fate of his beloved Mercédès and that of the other conspirators. He also assumes the identities of the English nobleman Lord Wilmore and Sinbad the Sailor, under which he does good for those who have always remained loyal to him.
But it is only ten years after his return to Marseille, which Edmond Dantès has spent consolidating his presence among those he wishes to avenge, that he decides to settle his score. Fernand Mondego, who had risen to become Count of Morcerf thanks to the wealth he had amassed as a conscript and had managed to marry Mercédès, is brought to trial.
He is accused of having betrayed Ali Pasha while serving as an officer in Greece. Outraged by his behavior, his wife and son decide to leave him, which drives Mondego to suicide. Gérard de Villefort, who, despite his knowledge of Dantès' innocence and the possibility of exonerating him, had decided to leave him in prison so as not to jeopardize his social position and political career, is driven mad by a series of poisonings to which members of his family fall victim and by the discovery of the Count's true identity.
Caderousse, who has become a money-grabbing criminal, is murdered by his own accomplice. Finally, Danglars, the architect of the original plot against Dantès, who has risen to become the richest banker in Paris, is also targeted. He is first driven to financial ruin, then kidnapped and imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he is forced to spend the rest of his money to buy food. After Dantès orders his release, the Count of Monte Cristo reveals his true identity and grants Danglars forgiveness in light of his sincere repentance.
