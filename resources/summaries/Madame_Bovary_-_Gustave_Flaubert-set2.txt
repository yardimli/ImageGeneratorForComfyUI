Madame Bovary
Gustave Flaubert


"Madame Bovary" by Gustave Flaubert is a groundbreaking novel that is often regarded as a milestone in the development of literary realism. The work captivates the reader with its profound characterization, precise language and realistic view of bourgeois life in the 19th century. The story follows Emma Bovary, a woman from France's rural middle class, whose unfulfilled dreams and longings for a more exciting life drive her into a series of unhappy love affairs and ultimately into a downward spiral of debt and despair.
Summary
"Madame Bovary" is set in the northern French countryside, not far from Rouen in Normandy. The protagonist, Charles Bovary, is introduced as a shy and oddly dressed boy who encounters much ridicule at a new school. Despite his difficulties, he completes a medical degree, albeit with only moderate success, and is accepted into the public health service. On the advice of his mother, he marries the unattractive but supposedly wealthy widow Héloïse Dubuc and begins to set up a practice in a village.
During a house call at a farm, where he treats the owner's broken leg, Charles meets the farmer's daughter, Emma Rouault. She is a strikingly beautiful and elegantly dressed young woman who has received a good education at the convent. Inspired by the novels she reads, she longs for a life of luxury and romance. Charles is immediately drawn to Emma and begins visiting his patient more frequently than required for medical reasons, until the jealous Héloïse intervenes and puts an end to his visits. After Héloïse's sudden death, Charles observes an appropriate period of mourning before seriously courting Emma. With her father's consent, the two finally marry.
As the novel progresses, Emma becomes the focus of the plot. After she and Charles attend a lavish ball, Emma finds her married life dull and unfulfilling. In the hope of counteracting her listlessness, Charles decides to move his practice to the livelier market town of Yonville. There Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but finds little joy in motherhood.
In Yonville she meets Léon Dupuis, a clever law student with a penchant for literature and music, who shares her feelings. Although they are attracted to each other, Emma does not admit her passion for Léon. Despairing over his unrequited love, he leaves the city and continues his studies in Paris.
Then the wealthy and charming landowner Rodolphe Boulanger enters Emma's life. He brings a servant to Charles for treatment and quickly becomes aware of Emma. Under the pretext that she should ride for health reasons, he invites her to accompany him. The gullible Charles agrees, and Emma and Rodolphe begin a passionate affair.
Emma's romantic ideas drive her to put herself in danger with careless letters and visits. After four years, she demands that she and Rodolphe elope. Rodolphe, however, has no desire for such an escape and ends the relationship painfully with a letter that he places in a basket of apricots that he sends to Emma. The subsequent shock causes Emma to fall seriously ill and she temporarily turns to religion.
After an almost complete recovery from her illness, Emma and Charles visit the opera in neighboring Rouen at his instigation. This experience reawakens Emma's passions and she meets Léon, who now lives in Rouen. The two resume their love affair. Charles believes that Emma is taking piano lessons, while she actually travels to the city every week to spend time with Léon in a hotel room that they treat as a shared home. The relationship is passionate at first, but over time Léon becomes bored with Emma's intense feelings, and her feelings towards him also become ambivalent.
In the meantime, Emma becomes increasingly indebted to the merchant Lheureux, indulging her penchant for luxury items and expensive clothes. When the debts fall due, she turns to several acquaintances for help, including Léon and Rodolphe, but is turned away. In her hopelessness, she takes arsenic, which she has stolen from the apothecary Homais, and suffers a painful death.
Charles, now overwhelmed by grief, turns Emma's room into a shrine and even adopts her tastes and preferences in order to keep her memory alive. He stops working, sells his possessions and the rest of his property is seized to pay off his debts. The discovery of Emma's love letters plunges him into a final breakdown and he dies.
Her daughter Berthe is initially placed with her grandmother, who soon dies. She is then placed with an impoverished aunt and eventually has to work in a cotton mill. At the end of the book, the apothecary Homais, once Charles' rival, rises in Yonville and is honored for his contributions to medicine.
