Diary of a Young Girl
Anne Frank

"Diary of a Young Girl," also known as "The Diary of Anne Frank," is the world-renowned journal of a young Jewish girl forced into hiding during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. For 25 months, Anne Frank chronicles her life confined within a "Secret Annex" in Amsterdam, sharing her fears, hopes, and adolescent observations with her diary, which she names "Kitty." The book is a powerful and poignant testament to the human spirit, capturing the daily struggles of confinement, the complexities of family life under extreme pressure, and a young writer's burgeoning self-awareness amidst the horrors of World War II.
Summary
The diary begins on June 14, 1942, just after Anne Frank's 13th birthday. Living in German-occupied Amsterdam, Anne describes her life as a Jewish schoolgirl, which is already constrained by harsh anti-Jewish laws: wearing a yellow star, observing strict curfews, and being barred from public places. Though she has friends and enjoys school, she feels she has no one to truly confide in and decides to make her new diary her closest friend, "Kitty."
Her life changes abruptly in July 1942 when her older sister, Margot, receives a call-up notice from the Gestapo, ordering her to a labor camp. The Frank family—Anne, Margot, and their parents Otto and Edith—immediately go into hiding. Their refuge is the "Secret Annex," a set of concealed rooms at the back of Otto Frank's office building. They are soon joined by the Van Daan family—Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan and their teenage son, Peter. The entrance to the Annex is hidden behind a movable bookshelf.
Life in the Annex is one of constant fear and tension. The occupants must remain silent during the day to avoid being discovered by the warehouse workers below. Anne documents the daily challenges: personality clashes, dwindling food supplies, and the terror of air raids. She adores her kind and patient father, Otto, but has a strained and difficult relationship with her mother, Edith, whom she feels does not understand her. She initially finds Peter Van Daan dull and Mrs. Van Daan overbearing. The group's survival depends on four of Otto's non-Jewish employees, known as the "protectors," including Miep Gies and Victor Kraler, who risk their lives to bring them food, supplies, and news from the outside world. In November 1942, an eighth person joins them: a Jewish dentist named Mr. Dussel, who becomes Anne's roommate, further straining her need for privacy.
As the months turn into a year, Anne matures significantly. She dedicates herself to studying and reading, but often feels misunderstood and criticized by the adults. She struggles with loneliness and depression, longing for fresh air and the freedom to be a normal teenager. She spends time in the attic, gazing at a chestnut tree through the skylight, which becomes her only connection to nature. In early 1944, her feelings for Peter Van Daan begin to change. They develop a close friendship that blossoms into a tentative romance, providing both with much-needed companionship and affection. This relationship marks a period of intense self-reflection for Anne, as she explores her feelings about love, her own identity, and her future.
Inspired by a radio broadcast from an exiled Dutch leader urging people to save wartime documents, Anne begins to edit and rewrite her diary with the intention of publishing it as a book after the war. She dreams of becoming a writer or journalist. Her writing becomes more profound as she grapples with the nature of humanity, her belief in people's inherent goodness despite the persecution, and her own dual nature—the cheerful, sometimes silly girl she presents to others, and the deeper, more serious Anne she keeps hidden. The news of the Allied D-Day invasion in June 1944 brings a surge of hope that liberation is near.
Anne's last diary entry is dated August 1, 1944. She reflects on her internal conflicts and her desire to become a better person. Three days later, on August 4, 1944, the Secret Annex was raided by the Gestapo, acting on a tip from an unknown informant. All eight occupants were arrested, along with two of their protectors. After the arrest, Miep Gies and Elli Vossen found Anne's diary scattered on the floor and saved it.
The inhabitants of the Annex were sent to concentration camps. Anne and Margot were eventually transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died of typhoid in March 1945, just weeks before the camp's liberation. Of the eight people who hid in the Annex, only Otto Frank survived the war. When he returned to Amsterdam, Miep Gies gave him Anne's diary. He fulfilled his daughter's wish by having it published in 1947.
