King Lear
William Shakespeare

King Lear is one of William Shakespeare’s most powerful and tragic plays, a searing exploration of pride, power, madness, betrayal, and redemption. The story revolves around the aging monarch King Lear, who, seeking to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, makes a fatal error in judgment that plunges his family and realm into chaos. Through the interwoven fates of Lear and the Earl of Gloucester, the play examines the collapse of order, the cruelty of fate, and the redemptive possibilities born from suffering.

Summary
The play opens as King Lear prepares to relinquish his throne and divide his kingdom among his three daughters—Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. He declares that the largest portion will go to the daughter who can most convincingly profess her love for him. Goneril, married to the Duke of Albany, and Regan, wife of the Duke of Cornwall, lavishly proclaim their devotion. However, Cordelia, Lear’s youngest and most beloved daughter, refuses to flatter him falsely and simply says, “Nothing, my lord.” Offended and humiliated, Lear disinherits her and divides her share between Goneril and Regan. Despite losing her dowry, Cordelia is taken as wife by the honorable King of France, while the Duke of Burgundy withdraws his proposal.

The Earl of Kent, loyal to Lear, protests the injustice and is banished. However, he returns in disguise to continue serving the king. Meanwhile, at Gloucester’s palace, Edmund, Gloucester’s illegitimate son, reveals his ambition to usurp the position of his legitimate brother, Edgar. Through deceit and a forged letter, Edmund convinces Gloucester that Edgar intends patricide, while misleading Edgar into fleeing from a supposed danger.

At Albany’s palace, Lear arrives with his retinue, but Goneril complains about the unruliness of his knights and his behavior. She demands he reduce his entourage. Outraged, Lear curses her and departs for Regan’s home. Goneril secretly warns Regan to treat Lear similarly.

At Gloucester’s castle, Edmund furthers his plan by faking an injury and accusing Edgar. Gloucester, deceived, orders Edgar’s arrest. Regan and Cornwall arrive and discuss the growing rift between Lear and his daughters. Kent, disguised, clashes with Oswald, Goneril’s steward, and is punished by being placed in the stocks. Lear arrives and is appalled at Kent’s treatment. Regan refuses him shelter and insists he return to Goneril. The two sisters unite in stripping him of his knights and dignity. Lear, furious and heartbroken, rushes into the storm with Kent and his Fool.

Amid the storm, Lear descends into madness. Kent finds him and leads him to a nearby hovel, where they encounter Edgar, disguised as “Poor Tom,” a mad beggar. Meanwhile, Gloucester, defying Regan and Cornwall, attempts to aid Lear. When Cornwall learns of this, he and Regan exact brutal revenge—Cornwall gouges out Gloucester’s eyes. A servant, horrified, tries to intervene and is killed by Regan. Mortally wounded, Cornwall succumbs later. Regan reveals to Gloucester that it was Edmund who betrayed him.

Blind and abandoned, Gloucester meets Edgar, still disguised, who becomes his guide. Gloucester asks to be led to a cliff in Dover to end his life. Edgar deceives him into thinking he has jumped, and when Gloucester survives, he interprets it as divine intervention.

Elsewhere, Goneril and Edmund engage in an affair. Albany, learning of his wife’s treachery, condemns her. A political struggle intensifies between Goneril and Regan over Edmund. Regan, now widowed after Cornwall’s death, plans to marry Edmund herself.

In Dover, Edgar leads Gloucester to a “cliff” and then helps him come to peace with his suffering. Lear, mad and wearing garlands, appears and is eventually reunited with Gloucester. Cordelia’s soldiers rescue Lear and take him to the French camp, where she and Kent nurse him back to lucidity.

The final act opens as British forces, led by Edmund, confront the French. Lear and Cordelia are captured. Edmund secretly orders their execution. Albany confronts Edmund with a letter from Goneril, exposing her plan to murder Albany and marry Edmund. Edgar appears in disguise and defeats Edmund in a duel, revealing his identity. Edmund, mortally wounded, repents and tries to revoke the order to kill Lear and Cordelia, but it is too late.

Cordelia is found hanged. Lear enters carrying her body, devastated. Overcome with grief, he dies. Goneril poisons Regan out of jealousy and then commits suicide. Edgar becomes king and is offered joint rule with Kent. Kent, however, declines, suggesting he is soon to follow Lear in death.
