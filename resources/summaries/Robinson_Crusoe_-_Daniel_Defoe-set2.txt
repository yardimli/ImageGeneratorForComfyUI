Robinson Crusoe
Daniel Defoe


"Robinson Crusoe" by Daniel Defoe is considered one of the first English novels and has significantly shaped the genre of the adventure novel. The book tells the story of Robinson Crusoe, a sailor who is stranded on an uninhabited island as the only survivor after a shipwreck. There he must survive for 28 years with the help of his skills, his ingenuity and occasional finds from the wreck of his ship before he can return to civilization. Crusoe's story is not only an adventure novel, but also a profound exploration of loneliness and human resilience that has inspired generations of readers.
Summary
Robinson Crusoe, the son of a German merchant from Bremen, whose original name was Kreutznaer, emigrated to England and married an Englishwoman from York. Crusoe was born in the port city of York in 1632. His father prepares him rigorously for his new status as a cadet and representative of the bourgeoisie and foresees a future for him as a lawyer. However, Crusoe, who has always been enthusiastic about life at sea, decides against his father's instructions as soon as he is nineteen years old. He wants to explore the world and discover new horizons, such as the Atlantic and the Canary Islands.
On one of his first voyages, Crusoe is captured by pirates off the coast of the Maghreb and held as a slave for two years. Eventually, he and others, including the young Xury, manage to escape from the Moroccan port of Sal√© by sailing south along the African Atlantic coast.
After Crusoe meets a captain in the Portuguese navy and hands Xury over to him - with the promise of releasing him after ten years of service, especially after the boy converts to Christianity - he is transported to Brazil. There, thanks to his special business skills, he manages to take over a sugar cane plantation.
Later, Robinson Crusoe sets sail again for Guinea, but the ship he is on sinks off the coast of Venezuela in a violent Caribbean storm and ends up stranded on an unknown island near the mouth of the Orinoco River. Robinson, the only survivor of the crew, rescues some muskets and useful equipment from the wreck before it is finally destroyed by strong winds, waves and the current. He transports them ashore on self-made rafts and prepares for his stay on the deserted island.
First he builds a fortress where he is safe at night; he begins to cultivate the land and make clothes from the skins of the wild goats that are plentiful on the island; later he even manages to breed the goats and bring them together in herds. One of the first things he builds is a large cross on which he engraves the date of his arrival, September 30, 1659. From then on, he carves a notch in the cross every day, like a calendar, so as not to lose track of time. He spends twenty-eight long years on this island, twelve of them in absolute solitude. Despite this, he adapts easily to his new way of life and even manages to catch and train a talking parrot to keep him company.
Robinson Crusoe decides to write down his daily experiences and adventures in a diary. He continues this diary until July 1660, when he runs out of ink. During a severe illness with a high fever, he experiences a vision: a man descends from a black cloud above a great flame and reminds him that his life has never been illuminated by the light of faith.
After his recovery, Robinson, who had never been particularly religious before, begins to strengthen his faith in God and is grateful for everything he finds on the island. He cultivates the ritual of reading at least one page of Holy Scripture every morning - the only book he has with him.
After twelve years of isolation, Robinson discovers that he is not alone: one day he sees a footprint on the beach that is larger than his own and finds the remains of a feast by the fire. He learns that the island is a place where the local savages bring prisoners of war to perform human sacrifice and cannibalism. Horrified by this practice, Robinson decides to intervene one day to free a victim who is to be sacrificed. He kills the attackers and rescues the prisoner, whom he calls "Friday", after the day of their encounter. Robinson teaches Friday the English language and leads him to the Christian faith by reading the Bible regularly.
Robinson then rescues two more victims who have been captured by the cannibals: one is Freitag's father and the other is a Spaniard. The Spaniard informs Robinson that more of his compatriots have been shipwrecked all over the island. The group then tries to work out a plan to rescue them. At that moment, an English ship anchors in front of the island; the crew has mutinied and decided to abandon the captain and the two sailors who have remained loyal to him on the seemingly uninhabited beach. After a fierce battle against the mutineers, Robinson and his friends managed to take firm possession of the ship, ending an exile that had lasted more than a quarter of a century.
Robinson left the island on 19 December 1686 and reached York, England, on 11 June of the following year, after 35 years away from Europe and its civilization. From there, he traveled with Freitag to Lisbon, where he met the Portuguese captain, who immediately gave him a detailed report on the situation of his plantations in Brazil. Robinson learns that he has only two sisters left and that his parents and brother have died. To his astonishment, he realizes that he has become a very rich man: thanks to the plantations, which have become incredibly fertile during his absence, he has earned a good 600,000 pounds.
On the way to transport his riches overland, Robinson and the faithful Friday experience their last great adventure: they fight a pack of ferocious, hungry wolves while crossing the Pyrenees.
After selling his plantations, Robinson invests the fortune he has earned, marries and starts a family; he has three children, but is soon widowed. In December 1694, after the death of his wife, he decided to return to the island where he had been shipwrecked. In April 1695, he arrives there, where a peaceful colony of Spaniards is now living. Robinson takes over the office of governor for a while.
After further, unspecified adventures, Robinson returns to England on January 10, 1705, almost 73 years old, where he finally decides to retire and spend the rest of his life in peace.
