Summary
War and Peace mixes fictional and historical characters, who are introduced at a soiree at Anna Pavlovna Scherer's house in July 1805. Pierre Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count who dies of a stroke when he unexpectedly becomes embroiled in a dispute over his father's inheritance. The intelligent and sardonic Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, husband of the enchanting Lise, feels unfulfilled in married life and prefers to serve as adjutant to Commander-in-Chief Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov in the upcoming war against Napoleon. The Rostov family from Moscow, which includes four teenagers, is also introduced. Of particular note are Natalya Rostova, known as "Natasha", the lively youngest daughter, and Nikolai Rostov, the eldest and most spirited teenager. In Lysye Gory, the "Bald Mountains", Prince Andrei leaves his pregnant wife in the care of his eccentric father and his mysterious sister Maria Bolkonskaya and goes off to war.
One of the main characters in War and Peace is undoubtedly Pierre Bezukhov. After receiving an unexpected inheritance, he is suddenly burdened with the responsibilities and conflicts of a Russian nobleman. His former insouciance disappears and is replaced by a dilemma typical of Tolstoy's poetics: How to live in harmony with morality in an imperfect world? He marries Hélène, the beautiful and immoral daughter of Prince Kuragin, contrary to his own convictions. Seized by jealousy, he faces his supposed rival in a duel and wins, even though he has never held a weapon in his hand. He separates from his wife and leaves her half of his fortune. Thoughtful and overwhelmed by doubts about life, he meets the Freemasons and becomes their fellow brother. With the best of intentions, he tries to free his peasants or serfs, but is betrayed by his stewards, which does not improve their living conditions. He also makes efforts to improve his farms, but without ultimately achieving success.
Prince Andrei, whose wife Lise has since died in childbirth, is seriously wounded in his first experience of war. After careful consideration, he decides to devote himself to managing his estates, during which time he begins to visit the house in Rostov and falls in love with the young Natasha, who reciprocates his feelings. However, this love is rejected by his old father. The latter's hostility prompts Prince Andrei to separate from Natasha for a year in the hope that their love will strengthen during this time.
Meanwhile, Hélène and her brother Anatole plan to seduce the young and attractive Natasha Rostova and discredit her. However, their plan narrowly fails. When Andrei finds out, he rejects Natasha, who then falls into a deep depression. For Pierre, however, this situation provides an opportunity to arrange an important meeting with the young Rostova.
When Napoleon invades Russia, Pierre observes the Battle of Borodino at close quarters and learns just how bloody and cruel the war really is. When Napoleon's Grande Armée occupies Moscow and the city is burned to the ground on the orders of Governor Fyodor Vasilyevich Rostopchin as a sign of resistance to the invaders, Pierre embarks on an absurd mission to assassinate Napoleon and is taken prisoner of war. After witnessing the sacking of Moscow by the French and the shooting of civilians, he is forced to march with the enemy troops on their disastrous retreat. He is later freed by a Russian gang that carries out a raid. Andrei, who is still in love with Natasha, is wounded in the Battle of Borodino and dies after being reunited with Natasha before the end of the war. Pierre, a widower, reunites with Natasha while the victorious Russians are rebuilding Moscow. Pierre finally finds love and marries Natasha, while Nikolai marries Maria Bolkonskaya.
Tolstoy effectively portrays the contrast between Napoleon and the Russian General Kutuzov, both in terms of personality and armed confrontation. Napoleon made the wrong decision, preferring to march on Moscow and occupy it for five disastrous weeks, when he would have done better to destroy the Russian army in a decisive battle. Kutuzov refused to sacrifice his own army to save Moscow: instead, he ordered a retreat and allowed the French to occupy the city. Once in Moscow, the Grande Armée dispersed and occupied houses more or less indiscriminately; the chain of command broke down and (in Tolstoy's opinion, inevitably) Moscow was destroyed by fire.
Tolstoy explains that this was inevitable, because when a city built largely of wood is left to foreigners, who naturally cook, smoke pipes and try to keep warm, fires are bound to start. Without organized firefighting, these fires would have burned down a large part of the city. After the fires, the French army, which was about to be disbanded, tried to make its way back, but had to contend with the harsh Russian winter and ambushes by local partisans.
Napoleon took his carriage with a team of fast horses and set off at the head of the army, but most of his men were never to see their homeland again. General Kutuzov is convinced that time is his most valuable ally: he continues to delay the decisive battle while the French are decimated on their arduous march home. When the Cossacks attack for the last time in the Battle of the Berezina, the Grande Armée is as good as destroyed.
