The Canterbury Tales
Geoffrey Chaucer
"The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffrey Chaucer is a seminal work of English literature, structured as a framing-tale, a collection of stories unified by the narrative of a journey. The book follows thirty pilgrims traveling from the outskirts of London to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket in Canterbury. To pass the time, they agree to a storytelling contest, with the winner receiving a free supper. This premise allows Chaucer to present a diverse cross-section of late 14th-century English society and to explore a wide range of literary genres, themes, and moral questions, revealing the religious, political, and social complexities of his time.

Summary
In the late 1300s, the narrator, a friendly and naive figure representing Chaucer himself, joins a group of 29 pilgrims at the Tabard Inn in Southwark, just outside London. The group is diverse, representing all levels of society except royalty. The innkeeper and Host, a wise and good-humored man named Harry Bailly, proposes a storytelling contest to entertain them on their journey. Each pilgrim will tell tales, and whoever tells the most entertaining one with the best moral will win a supper at his inn, paid for by the others. The pilgrims agree, and their journey and stories begin the next morning.

The contest begins with the Knight, an aristocrat and landowner who represents social order and chivalry. His tale is a romance set in ancient Athens. Two knights, Palamon and Arcite, are imprisoned in a tower from which they both see and fall in love with the beautiful Emily. This sparks a bitter rivalry. Arcite is eventually released, and Palamon escapes. They later meet and are fighting over Emily when Duke Theseus discovers them. He arranges a grand tournament to decide who will marry her. Arcite wins the tournament but is mortally wounded in a fall from his horse immediately after. On his deathbed, he reconciles with Palamon, urging him to marry Emily. After a long period of mourning, Theseus weds Palamon and Emily.

The Miller, a brawny and down-to-earth grinder of grain, follows with a crude and humorous fabliau. In his tale, a cunning Oxford student named Nicholas boards with an old carpenter, John, and lusts after his young wife, Alison. To get the husband out of the way, Nicholas predicts a second great flood and convinces John to hang three tubs from the ceiling to use as escape boats. Once John is asleep in his tub, Nicholas and Alison sneak into bed together. A local parish clerk, Absolon, who also loves Alison, comes to the window asking for a kiss. Alison tricks him by sticking her buttocks out the window, which he kisses in the dark. Seeking revenge, Absolon returns with a hot poker. This time, Nicholas offers his own buttocks, and Absolon brands him. Nicholas’s cry for "Water!" awakens the carpenter, who, thinking the flood has begun, cuts the rope holding his tub and crashes to the floor, breaking his arm.

The Wife of Bath, a worldly, gap-toothed weaver scouting for her sixth husband, offers a prologue about her life before her tale. She tells of her five marriages and how she maintained control, using her sexuality over her first three husbands and jealousy over the fourth. After a violent fight with her fifth husband, an antifeminist scholar, she gained control over his home and land. Her tale follows, telling of a knight in King Arthur's court condemned to death for raping a maiden. The queen spares him on the condition that he returns in one year with the answer to what women most desire. An old, ugly hag provides the answer—that women desire control in their marriages—in exchange for his promise to grant her first request. The answer saves his life, and she promptly asks him to marry her. Distressed by her age and appearance, the knight is miserable. The hag offers him a choice: she can be old, ugly, and faithful, or young, beautiful, and possibly unfaithful. He gives her the choice, thereby giving her the control she spoke of. Pleased, she becomes both young, beautiful, and faithful.

The Friar, a member of a religious order who lives a life of luxury, tells a tale about a wicked summoner who extorts money from people by falsely accusing them of sin. On his way to cheat an old widow, the summoner meets a yeoman who is actually a devil in disguise. They travel together to the widow's house, where the summoner badgers her for money. When she curses him, saying "the Devil take your body," the devil asks if she truly means it. She confirms that she does, unless the summoner repents. The summoner refuses, and the devil carts him off to hell.

In retaliation, the Summoner, a loathsome man who takes bribes and frightens children with his ugly appearance, tells a tale about a greedy friar. The friar’s incessant begging enrages a bedridden man named John, who offers the friar a gift on the condition he divides it evenly among the twelve members of his convent. The friar agrees and reaches behind John’s back for the promised gift, whereupon John lets out a loud fart. The insulted friar takes the matter to a local lord, whose clever page devises a solution: a twelve-spoked wheel will be used, with the twelve friars placing their noses at the end of each spoke while John farts at the hub.

The Clerk, a serious Oxford student devoted to philosophy, tells the tale of the marquis Walter, who marries a poor, virtuous woman named Griselda. He tests her devotion by making her promise to obey him unquestioningly. He then pretends to have their daughter and son taken away and killed. Years later, he asks her to prepare for his wedding to a new, younger bride. Griselda’s willing and patient acceptance of all his cruel actions finally convinces him of her virtue. He restores their children to her and reaffirms their marriage, and they live happily ever after.

The Merchant, a member of the rising middle class, tells a cynical tale of marriage. Lustful, 60-year-old January marries the beautiful young May and builds an enclosed garden, symbolizing a corrupted Eden, for their pleasure. May falls in love with a young squire named Damian, and after January goes blind, they plan to meet in the garden. May climbs a pear tree to be with Damian, stepping on her husband's back to do so. At that moment, January's sight is miraculously restored, and he sees his wife and the squire in a sexual embrace. The quick-witted May convinces him that his sight was restored by her struggling in the tree with a man, and he reluctantly believes her.

The Franklin, a wealthy landowner, offers a tale about a marriage based on love and mutual respect. The French knight Arveragus marries his beloved Dorigen, who promises him her faithfulness. When he sails to England for battle, a squire named Aurelius professes his love for her. Worried her husband’s ship will crash on the rocky coast upon his return, she tells Aurelius she will love him if he can make the dangerous rocks disappear. Aurelius hires a magician who creates an illusion that the rocks have vanished. Arveragus returns home safely, and when he learns of Dorigen's promise, he insists she honor it. Moved by such faithfulness, Aurelius releases her from her vow, and the magician, in turn, releases Aurelius from his large fee.

Before his tale, the Pardoner, a preacher who sells papal pardons and fake relics for profit, delivers a prologue revealing his methods. He admits he uses his sermons against greed—"radix malorum est cupiditas" (greed is the root of all evil)—as a way to make people feel guilty and buy his pardons, thus feeding his own avarice. His tale is a powerful exemplum about three young rioters who, upon hearing of a friend’s death, decide to find and kill Death. They encounter an old man, a symbol of Death itself, who tells them they will find Death under a nearby tree. There, they discover eight bushels of gold coins. They plot to keep it, and the youngest is sent to town for food and wine. He decides to poison two of the wine bottles to kill the others and keep the gold for himself. When he returns, his two friends kill him, then drink the poisoned wine and die. The moral is stark: in seeking Death, the rioters found it through their greed.

The Shipman's tale involves a merchant's wife who complains to a monk, John, that her husband is stingy. She borrows 100 francs from John—who had borrowed it from her husband—to buy a dress, and she has sex with the monk in return. When the merchant returns, John claims he repaid the debt to the wife. She tells her husband she thought the money was a gift and spent it. The merchant accepts the loss.

The Prioress, a nun named Madame Eglantine with dainty, aristocratic manners, tells an anti-Semitic tale. A seven-year-old Christian boy sings a hymn to the Virgin Mary on his way through a Jewish ghetto. The Jews hire a murderer to kill him. His widowed mother later finds him in a pit, still miraculously singing, his throat slit. The Virgin Mary had placed a magical grain on his tongue. The local authorities have the Jews tortured and killed. When an abbot removes the grain, the boy finally dies and is honored as a martyr.

The Nun's Priest tells one of the most celebrated tales, a beast fable about a rooster named Chanticleer. Chanticleer has a nightmare about a fox but is shamed by his wife, Pertelote, who calls him a coward. Later, a flattering fox tricks the proud rooster into closing his eyes and singing, then seizes him and runs. As the barnyard gives chase, Chanticleer cleverly advises the fox to taunt his pursuers. When the fox opens his mouth to do so, Chanticleer flies to safety in a tree, having learned not to be fooled by flattery twice.

The Parson, an idealized Christlike figure, concludes the storytelling not with a tale but with a long sermon on penitence. He details its three parts—contrition, confession, and satisfaction—and discusses the seven deadly sins, ending with the promise of "the endless bliss of heaven" as the reward for true repentance.

Finally, in a closing statement known as Chaucer's Retraction, the author asks for his audience's forgiveness for his literary sins and any offense caused by his work, and he requests prayers for his salvation.
