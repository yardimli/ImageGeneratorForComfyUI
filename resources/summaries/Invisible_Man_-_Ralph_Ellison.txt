Invisible Man
Ralph Ellison

Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison is a powerful novel of self-discovery and racial identity in mid-20th century America. The unnamed Black narrator journeys from naive submission to awakening as he grapples with prejudice, betrayal, invisibility, and self-realization. The story begins in the present, where the narrator lives in an underground basement in New York, and recounts the events of his past in a long flashback. Through an often surreal and symbolic lens, Ellison explores the struggle for individuality in a society that refuses to truly “see” Black people. The novel won the National Book Award in 1953 and is considered one of the most significant works of 20th-century American literature.

Summary
The unnamed narrator begins with a Prologue, declaring: “I am an invisible man.” He explains that this invisibility is not literal, but social—he is unseen because people refuse to see him beyond their racial assumptions. He lives hidden in a basement beneath a whites-only building in New York City, where he steals electricity and reflects on the events that led him there. This philosophical prologue introduces the themes of identity, invisibility, and awakening.

Chapter 1 recounts the narrator's youth in a Southern town where Black people serve white interests. Haunted by his grandfather's last words—“overcome them with yeses”—the narrator grows up obedient, believing humility is the key to Black progress. He gives a graduation speech on this theme and is invited to repeat it for the town’s white elite. However, the event turns out to be a humiliating “Battle Royal.” He and other Black youths are forced to fight blindfolded, crawl for electrified coins, and endure racist abuse. Bloodied, he gives his speech to an inattentive crowd, but is rewarded with a briefcase and a scholarship to a Black college.

Chapters 2–6 follow the narrator to the college, where he becomes the driver for Mr. Norton, a wealthy white trustee. Norton asks for a tour and is taken to the poor Black part of town. They stop at Jim Trueblood’s cabin, where the man tells Norton about impregnating both his wife and daughter during a cold night when they all shared a bed. Though horrified, Norton gives Trueblood $100. Norton then faints, and the narrator takes him to the Golden Day—a wild bar and brothel. There, an insane Black war veteran, once a doctor, treats Norton and challenges his racial assumptions, insisting on equal treatment. The experience enrages Norton.

After the incident, the narrator is expelled by Dr. Bledsoe, the college president, who reveals his duplicity: Black people should never reveal the truth to whites, only what they want to see. Bledsoe gives the narrator letters of recommendation for jobs in New York, but secretly they say he should never be readmitted.

Chapters 7–15 take place in New York, where the narrator is shocked by urban life. He delivers Bledsoe’s letters and learns of the betrayal—they sabotage his future. He finds work at Liberty Paints, a company that prides itself on its “Optic White” paint, which ironically requires drops of black liquid to become white. He is sent to work with Lucius Brockway, a suspicious old Black man who guards the paint formula. A fight causes an explosion, and the narrator is hospitalized. In the factory hospital, he undergoes electroshock therapy and temporarily loses his memory.

After his release, he is taken in by Mary Rambo, a kind maternal figure in Harlem. One day, he witnesses an elderly Black couple being evicted and gives an impromptu speech urging the crowd to resist. His oratory draws the attention of Brother Jack, a white leader of a Communist-like organization called The Brotherhood. Jack offers him a job as their spokesperson. Though reluctant, the narrator accepts, driven by financial need. He repays his debts and begins a new life on the Upper East Side.

Chapters 16–24 explore his rise in The Brotherhood. His first speech is criticized for being too emotional, not scientific. He studies their ideology and becomes head of Harlem’s district. There he meets Ras the Exhorter, a militant Black nationalist who accuses him and his friend Tod Clifton of betrayal for working with whites. The narrator succeeds in organizing rallies and gains popularity, earning the trust of men like Brother Tarp, a former chain gang prisoner who gives him a symbolic chain link.

But trouble brews. He receives an anonymous warning (from Brother Jack) reminding him to remain obedient. After being reprimanded by the Brotherhood for personal ambition, he is reassigned to speak on “the woman question.” At a lecture, Sybil, the wife of a Brotherhood official, flirts with him, and they sleep together.

Eventually, Tod Clifton vanishes. The narrator finds him selling degrading Sambo dolls on the street. A scuffle with police ends with Clifton being shot dead. The narrator organizes a funeral and delivers a heartfelt eulogy, defying the Brotherhood's cold ideology. He is reprimanded again for his independence and sent back to study under Brother Hambro.

As racial tensions rise, the narrator dons dark glasses and a hat to avoid being recognized. People mistake him for Rinehart, a mysterious and immoral figure—a gambler, preacher, and pimp—whom he never meets. The disguise opens his eyes to the fluidity of identity.

Disillusioned, the narrator learns that The Brotherhood plans to abandon Harlem. He pretends to comply while deceiving them, inventing member lists and reports. Suddenly, a race riot erupts. Amid the chaos, he sees Ras—now called Ras the Destroyer—riding a black horse and calling for violence. Ras accuses the narrator of betrayal and throws a spear at him. The narrator retaliates and flees, eventually falling into a manhole.

Chapter 25 finds him trapped underground in the dark, burning his symbolic possessions (diploma, letters, Sambo doll) to create light. After days of isolation, hunger, and rage, he dreams of being castrated by the figures who betrayed him. Awakened, he accepts that he has lived under illusions. He realizes the importance of self-reliance and decides to abandon his past and emerge from the darkness.

In the Epilogue, the narrator reflects on how he has always lived by others’ expectations, not his own desires. Now, he chooses to take responsibility for his life and prepare to reenter society, embracing both his invisibility and humanity.
