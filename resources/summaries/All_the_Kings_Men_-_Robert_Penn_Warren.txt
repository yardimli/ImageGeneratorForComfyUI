Summary
In 1939, narrator Jack Burden, a former journalist, reflects on his time working for Willie Stark, the powerful governor of a Southern state. The story begins in 1936, when Willie, accompanied by his entourage—including his estranged wife Lucy, arrogant son Tom, shrewd mistress and secretary Sadie Burke, and devious lieutenant governor Tiny Duffy—is on a public relations tour. When the influential Judge Montague Irwin announces his opposition to Willie's political plans, Willie orders Jack to "find something" on the judge to use as blackmail.
A flashback reveals Willie Stark's origins. In the 1920s, he was an honest, naive county treasurer who was fired for protesting a corrupt school-building contract. When a faulty fire escape at that school later collapses and kills several children, Willie becomes a local hero. In 1926, a political machine led by Joe Harrison recruits Willie to run for governor as a "dummy candidate" to split the rural vote. When Willie learns he has been used, he transforms. Fueled by whiskey and rage, he abandons his dry, fact-based speeches for fiery, demagogic tirades against the corrupt establishment, becoming a champion of the common man. Though he loses that election, he builds a powerful base and is elected governor by a landslide in 1930, bringing Sadie Burke as his mistress and Tiny Duffy as a subordinate he can control.
As governor, Willie achieves significant social reforms but employs blackmail, bribery, and intimidation. Jack Burden becomes his key operative, filling black notebooks with incriminating information on Willie's political enemies. Jack, the son of the "scholarly attorney" Ellis Burden, is haunted by his own past, including his failed Ph.D. dissertation on an ancestor, Cass Mastern, and his unfulfilled love for his childhood friend, Anne Stanton. When Willie faces an impeachment attempt, he uses Jack's research to crush the opposition and secure his power.
Jack's investigation into Judge Irwin uncovers a decades-old scandal: as a young attorney general, Irwin accepted a bribe to drop a lawsuit, an act covered up by his friend, the then-governor Joel Stanton—the late father of Anne and her brother, the idealistic surgeon Adam Stanton. Willie uses this information to manipulate the Stantons. He pressures Anne to persuade Adam to become the director of a new, state-of-the-art hospital Willie is building. Jack is horrified to discover that Anne has not only complied but has also become Willie's mistress.
Shattered, Jack flees west, developing a cynical philosophy he calls the "Great Twitch," which posits that all human actions are meaningless, involuntary spasms and no one is responsible for anything. He returns to a series of crises. Willie's son, Tom, is paralyzed in a football accident, and Willie is simultaneously blackmailed over a paternity suit against Tom. To gain leverage, Willie orders Jack to use the information against Judge Irwin. Jack confronts the judge, who promptly commits suicide. Immediately after, Jack's mother hysterically reveals that Judge Irwin was Jack's real father.
The tragedies cause Willie to have a moral crisis. He reconciles with his wife, ends his affair with Anne, and cancels a corrupt deal for his hospital, publicly humiliating Tiny Duffy in the process. Seeking revenge, a spurned Sadie Burke tells Duffy about Willie's affair with Anne. Duffy, in turn, relays this information to the proud and unstable Adam Stanton, framing it as the reason he was offered the hospital directorship. Enraged and feeling his honor has been destroyed, Adam goes to the state capitol, assassinates Willie Stark, and is instantly killed by Willie's bodyguard.
In the aftermath, Jack pieces together how the vindictive Tiny Duffy, who is now the new governor, orchestrated Willie's death. Tempted to have Duffy killed, Jack ultimately rejects the cycle of vengeance. He and Anne, finding their way back to each other, marry. Jack rejects his old philosophies of the "Great Sleep" and the "Great Twitch," finally accepting the weight of the past and the reality of human responsibility. He takes in his dying non-biological father, Ellis Burden, and resumes his work on the Cass Mastern story, now believing he can finally understand the complex connections between action, consequence, and history.
