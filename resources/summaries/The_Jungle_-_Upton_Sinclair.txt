The Jungle
Upton Sinclair
Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle" is a powerful and harrowing novel that exposes the brutal realities faced by immigrants in early 20th-century America. The story follows Jurgis Rudkus and his Lithuanian family as they arrive in the stockyards of Chicago, chasing the American dream, only to be crushed by the ruthless machinery of industrial capitalism. More than just a story of one family's struggle, the novel is a searing indictment of corporate greed, unsafe working conditions, and political corruption, which ultimately serves as a passionate argument for socialism.

Summary
Jurgis Rudkus, a strong young man from the Lithuanian wilderness, meets Ona Lukoszaite at a horse fair. When Ona's family decides to follow a friend, Jokubas Szedvilas, who has supposedly gotten rich in America, Jurgis joins them. After being swindled by an agent during their journey, the extended family arrives in the Packingtown district of Chicago. They take a tour of the immense packinghouses, marveling at the mechanical efficiency of an operation that processes 10,000 cattle a day, oblivious to the ruthless competition that defines the industry. Buoyed by his strength, Jurgis quickly finds a job, as do Ona's cousin Marija Berczynskas and her uncle Jonas. However, Jurgis’s elderly father, Dede Antanas, struggles to find work, teaching the family that America does not value age as their old country did.
Flush with initial earnings, the family buys a house they saw advertised, only to discover it is old and requires constant, expensive repairs. The financial strain forces Ona and her young son, Stanislovas, to seek employment, with the boy joining the millions of underage laborers in the country. The family soon experiences its first tragedies. After finally saving enough to have a proper wedding feast, they are dismayed when guests fail to follow the old-world tradition of contributing to the cost, a sign that cooperation has yielded to competition. As winter arrives, Dede Antanas, working in a dark, unheated cellar, dies of tuberculosis. Marija gets engaged to a man named Tomaszius, but they are both laid off before they can marry. Seeking solace, many workers frequent the saloons, which offer free meals with the purchase of drinks. The family begins to see the labor union as a "new religion" and learns of the immense power wielded by Mike Scully, the local Democratic boss.
Jurgis learns English and becomes a citizen, but the family's troubles worsen. Ona gives birth to a son, Antanas, but also discovers that her boss, Connor, is sexually exploiting her. Soon after, Jurgis suffers a workplace injury and is fired. No longer a prime specimen, he is forced to take the most degrading job available—at the fertilizer plant. When Jonas deserts the family, more of the children must leave school to sell newspapers, where they are exposed to the immorality of the streets. Ona's stepmother, Elzbieta Lukoszaite, finds work in a sausage factory and learns of the industry's horrific secrets, such as processing diseased meat, rat dung, and poisoned bread alongside other ingredients. Elzbieta's son Kristoforas dies, likely from eating contaminated food. Jurgis turns to alcohol, and Ona, ill during a second pregnancy, suffers from hysteria. When Jurgis learns that Connor has been forcing Ona into sex by threatening her job, he flies into a rage and attacks the man.
Jurgis is arrested and jailed for 30 days, where he experiences the injustices of the legal system and meets a safecracker named Jack Duane. While he is incarcerated, the family, deprived of his and Ona's wages, is evicted from their house. Upon his release, Jurgis finds them living in Aniele Jukniene's filthy boarding house. He arrives to find Ona in a difficult labor in the unheated attic. He rushes to find a midwife, Madame Haupt, but it is too late; both Ona and the baby die. Despondent, Jurgis is convinced by Elzbieta to live for his son, Antanas. Blacklisted in Packingtown, he finds work in a downtown factory, but it soon shuts down. The family survives by scavenging in the city dump until Jurgis finds a job in the steel mills. Just as hope returns, he comes home one day to find that his son has drowned in a putrid, standing pool of water in the street.
Utterly broken, Jurgis abandons his remaining family and hops a train out of the city. In the countryside, he bathes and feels his health and vigor return, taking odd jobs with other tramps and harvest crews. He spends his earnings on drink and debauchery, but is haunted by his past. With winter's arrival, he returns to Chicago and gets a job digging underground tunnels. After another industrial accident leaves him unable to work, he becomes a beggar. One night, he meets Freddie Jones, the drunken son of a Beef Trust magnate, who invites him to his Lakeshore Drive mansion. A servant gives Jurgis a $100 bill for a cab, which he keeps. The encounter shows him firsthand the immense wealth built on the suffering of workers like himself.
When a bartender cheats him while trying to change the $100 bill, Jurgis gets into a fight, is arrested, and sentenced to 10 days in jail, where he again meets Jack Duane. He is introduced to the "army of graft" that allows a few powerful men to rule the city and is connected with Mike Scully's political machine. Jurgis enters the world of crime and political corruption, returning to Packingtown under Scully's protection to work as a scab and rig an election. He rises to become a boss over the newest wave of exploited workers but his prosperity is cut short when he runs into Connor again, attacks him, and is jailed. His political connections are not enough to save him, and he is forced to use his savings to skip bail.
Once again a beggar, he finds life as a tramp harder than before. One evening, seeking warmth, he wanders into a political rally. In the street afterwards, he learns that Marija has become a morphine-addicted prostitute to survive. He finds her, only to be swept up in a police raid. He also learns that Stanislovas was killed, eaten alive by rats in the factory where he worked. Distraught, Jurgis returns to another political hall where he hears an orator speak passionately about the struggles of the working class. The speaker's words resonate deeply, and Jurgis feels a sense of freedom.
He learns the man was speaking of socialism and is introduced to a "comrade" who explains the system of greed and price-fixing that defines the Beef Trust. Jurgis comes to understand that political freedom is meaningless under an economic system of wage slavery and that workers must unite. Socialism becomes his "new religion." He finds a job at a hotel run by a Socialist, Tommy Hinds, and dedicates himself to his political education. He attends a meeting where a philosopher, Dr. Schliemann, outlines the principles of socialism and decries the waste, corruption, and exploitation inherent in capitalism. His conversion gives him a new purpose. Reconnecting with Elzbieta, he commits to supporting his family. The novel ends as the results of the 1904 election show substantial gains for the Socialist party, with an orator leading Jurgis and his comrades in a final, hopeful cry: “Chicago will be ours!”
