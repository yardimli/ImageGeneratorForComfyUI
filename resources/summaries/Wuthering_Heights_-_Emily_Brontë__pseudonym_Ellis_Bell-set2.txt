Wuthering Heights
Emily Brontë / pseudonym: Ellis Bell


"Wuthering Heights", the only novel by Emily Brontë, is a masterpiece of English literature and is one of the most important novels of the 19th century. The book tells the passionate and often destructive love story between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw and its impact on the surrounding families. The plot unfolds on the bleak and stormy West Yorkshire moors and is known for its profound psychological insights and complex structure.
Summary
In 1801, Mr. Lockwood, who has recently rented Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire, travels to visit his landlord, Heathcliff, who lives in a distant house called Wuthering Heights. There he meets a taciturn young lady known as Cathy Linton, a grim servant named Joseph, and Hareton, a young man who behaves like a servant. The atmosphere is gloomy and not particularly inviting. When Lockwood is stuck in the house at night due to a snowstorm, he rummages through a diary that belonged to Catherine Earnshaw. He then experiences a nightmare in which a ghostly creature, who reveals itself to be Catherine, tries to enter through the window. When he cries out in fright, Heathcliff reacts with obvious alarm.
Later, during a heavy snowstorm, Lockwood returns to Thrushcross Grange, catches a cold and is confined to bed. During his recuperation, his housekeeper, Ellen "Nelly" Dean, tells him the background to the strange family of Wuthering Heights.
Nelly's Story
Thirty decades earlier, the Earnshaw family, consisting of the children Hindley and Catherine and the servant Nelly, reside in Wuthering Heights. After a trip to Liverpool, Earnshaw returns home with an orphan whom he christens Heathcliff. The boy becomes Earnshaw's favorite child, causing his own children to fade into the background and be neglected, especially after the loss of his wife. Hindley mistreats Heathcliff, who in turn forms a deep bond with Catherine.
Hindley goes to university and only returns three years later, after the death of his father, as the new lord of Wuthering Heights. He and his wife Frances take Heathcliff in as a servant.
One day, Catherine and Heathcliff observe Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella, who live at Thrushcross Grange. Catherine is injured by the Lintons' dog and stays with them, while Heathcliff is sent home. When the Lintons visit Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff is mocked by Hindley and Edgar, which leads to an argument. Heathcliff is imprisoned and harbors thoughts of revenge.
After Frances dies giving birth to her son Hareton, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar two years later. She reveals to Nelly that although she loves Heathcliff, she cannot marry him because he is socially inferior to her. Heathcliff overhears only part of the conversation and flees the house, believing that Catherine does not love him. Catherine then falls into a serious illness, plagued by despair.
Three years after Heathcliff has left Wuthering Heights and while Edgar and Catherine are married, he returns as a wealthy gentleman. In order to take revenge on Catherine, he exploits Isabella's affection for him. Edgar's dislike of Heathcliff's presence leads to a rift, and Catherine responds by going on a self-imposed hunger strike while pregnant, from which she never fully recovers. Meanwhile, Hindley loses Wuthering Heights to Heathcliff through debt, and Heathcliff flees with Isabella, but their relationship breaks down.
After Heathcliff learns of Catherine's impending death, he visits her in secret. She dies after the birth of her daughter, Cathy, whereupon Heathcliff angrily summons her ghost to haunt him for the rest of his life. Isabella flees and gives birth to Linton, Heathcliff's son. With Hindley's death, Heathcliff becomes lord of Wuthering Heights.
Twelve years later, Heathcliff takes the sick Linton after Isabella's death. Cathy and Linton, who live in Grange and Wuthering Heights, begin a relationship. Heathcliff's plan to marry them off becomes a reality, and after Edgar's death they move in with him. Heathcliff's behavior worsens as he is haunted by Catherine's ghost, and he reveals that he has dug up her grave. After Linton's death, Cathy remains trapped in Wuthering Heights. This ends Nelly's account in the present.
The End
Lockwood has had enough of the moors and leaves. However, he returns eight months later and visits Wuthering Heights, where he meets Nelly, who is now the housekeeper there. She tells him that Cathy taught Hareton to read and tells him about Heathcliff's visions of the deceased Catherine. Heathcliff withdrew from the young people as he could not bear to look into the eyes that reminded him of Catherine. He stopped eating and was found dead in Catherine's old room a few days later.
Lockwood learns that Cathy and Hareton are planning to marry and move to Grange, while Joseph takes over the management of Wuthering Heights. Nelly also reports that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff wandering around together. As Lockwood walks past the graves of Catherine, Edgar and Heathcliff, he is firmly convinced that the deceased have finally found peace.
