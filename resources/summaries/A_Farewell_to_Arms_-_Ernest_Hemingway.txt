A Farewell to Arms
Ernest Hemingway

"A Farewell to Arms" by Ernest Hemingway is a seminal work of modernist literature and one of the most famous war novels ever written. Set against the backdrop of World War I, the novel chronicles the passionate love affair between Frederic Henry, an American ambulance driver in the Italian army, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The book is renowned for its stark portrayal of the brutality and disillusionment of war, its exploration of love as a fragile sanctuary in a chaotic world, and Hemingway's iconic, understated prose style.
Summary
In 1917, on the Italian front of World War I, Frederic Henry, a young American volunteer, serves as an ambulance driver. Bored and detached from the war, he meets Catherine Barkley, a British nurse's aide still mourning the death of her fianc√©. What begins as a casual flirtation for Frederic deepens after he is severely wounded in the leg by a mortar shell. He is sent to an American hospital in Milan to recover, where Catherine is also transferred.
In Milan, away from the immediate horrors of the front, their relationship blossoms into a profound and passionate love affair. They create a private world for themselves, finding moments of happiness and peace amidst the ongoing war. Their idyllic summer ends when Catherine reveals she is pregnant. At the same time, Frederic, having recovered from his injury and a subsequent bout of jaundice, is ordered to return to his unit. They part with heavy hearts as the autumn rains begin.
Frederic returns to a demoralized and chaotic front line just in time for the disastrous retreat from Caporetto. Caught in the mayhem, he is separated from his unit and witnesses the complete breakdown of military order. At a river crossing, he is seized by Italian military police who are summarily executing officers suspected of being German infiltrators. To save his own life, Frederic dives into the river and escapes, making a "separate peace" and deserting the army.
He makes his way back to Catherine, who is now in Stresa. To avoid Frederic's certain arrest, the lovers make a daring nighttime escape by rowing across Lake Maggiore to neutral Switzerland. They spend a peaceful and idyllic winter in a cabin in the mountains above Montreux, awaiting the birth of their child. This period represents their final, desperate attempt to build a life separate from the world's violence.
In the spring, they move to Lausanne for the delivery. Catherine endures a long and agonizing labor, which ultimately requires a caesarean section. The baby, a boy, is born dead, strangled by the umbilical cord. Shortly after, Catherine begins to hemorrhage and, despite the doctors' efforts, dies in Frederic's arms. Utterly broken and alone, Frederic walks back to his hotel in the rain.
