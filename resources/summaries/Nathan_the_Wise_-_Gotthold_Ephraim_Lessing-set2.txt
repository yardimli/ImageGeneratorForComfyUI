Nathan the Wise
Gotthold Ephraim Lessing


"Nathan the Wise" by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing is a ground-breaking work of the Enlightenment in five acts that has lost none of its topicality and significance to this day. It deals with aspects such as tolerance, humanity, reason, religious diversity and human nature. The plot is set in 12th century Jerusalem, during the time of the Crusades, and follows the story of Nathan, a Jewish merchant who is portrayed as a role model of tolerance and wisdom. The play highlights the relationships between the different religious and cultural groups - Christians, Jews and Muslims - and shows how understanding and compassion can bridge the gap between them.
Summary
Act One
Nathan, a Jewish merchant, returns to Jerusalem from Babylon, where he has been traveling on business. Daja, the Christian companion of his daughter Recha, tells him that his house has burned down. Recha was only saved thanks to the intervention of a mysterious Templar who has since disappeared. This Knight Templar was initially imprisoned and was later pardoned by Sultan Saladin, the Muslim ruler of Jerusalem, because he looked like Saladin's deceased brother Assad. Recha claims that the one who rescued her was an angel, while Nathan convinces her that it was a man who intervened by a miraculous coincidence. Al-Hafi, a former dervish and now Saladin's treasurer and Nathan's friend, arrives. He asks him to help him with his task, but Nathan not only refuses, but instead advises him to return to the freedom of his former profession. The Templar meets a monk sent by the Patriarch, who tells him to deliver a letter to King Philip with information for an ambush against Saladin. He refuses, however, because Saladin has saved his life.
Act Two
Saladin plays chess with his sister Sittah and suffers a defeat. He orders Al-Hafi to give her the winnings, but he confesses that the money in the treasury has run out. Saladin orders Al-Hafi to go to Nathan and ask him for a loan. Nathan looks for the Templar to thank him. When he finds him, Nathan tells him how true it is that people are good and brotherly, regardless of their origin or religion. The Templar replies that the Jewish people were the first to declare themselves chosen, the first to impose their God on the whole world as the best and whose pride, which later spread to Christians and Muslims, infected the whole world. Nathan replies that the Templar is right, but that he does not want to see a Christian in him, but a man like him, and asks him to do the same. So he and the Templar become friends and he confides in him that his name is Curd von Stauffen, a name that brings back memories for Nathan. Daja arrives and tells Nathan that he has been summoned by Saladin. After that, Al-Hafi arrives and explains to him why Saladin has summoned him, that he is no longer able to act as his treasurer and that he is about to leave for India where he will return to work as a dervish.
Act Three
Recha and Daja talk about God. The Christian servant wants the Templar to take Recha to Europe. She wants her God, the God she fights for, to take her to the land where she belongs. Recha rebukes her, because God does not belong to anyone and does not need anyone to fight for him. The Templar arrives and falls in love with Recha, while the desire she had for him fades. The Templar then goes to the Sultan to fetch Nathan. Meanwhile, Saladin does not ask Nathan for money, but asks him - to test his wisdom - which faith is the truest. Nathan answers with the "Ring Parable":
Once upon a time in the East there was a man who possessed a ring that had the power to fill anyone who wore it with trusting gratitude towards God and man. The man left the ring to his favorite son and this tradition continued until a descendant had three sons whom he loved equally. During his lifetime, he promised all three of them the ring, and before he died, he had two identical copies made so that he could give each of his sons a ring. The three rings were indistinguishable on the outside and it was impossible to prove which was the real one.
The three brothers argued about the authenticity of their rings and went to see a judge. The judge interpreted the father's gesture as an act of love and advised the brothers to act as if each of them possessed the real ring. He advised them to prove their virtues through charity and devotion to God. The judge said that the true virtues of the rings would be revealed in the descendants. He urged the grandsons of the grandsons to return to his wiser successor, who could then decide the matter once and for all.
Nathan then proposes to lend him money. Saladin thanks him and sends for the Templar. The Templar meets Nathan and asks him for his daughter's hand in marriage, but he hesitates because he wants to know which branch of the Stauffen he belongs to. The Templar then meets with Daja, who confesses to him that Recha is in fact the daughter of Christians and therefore neither Jewish nor Nathan's daughter.
Act Four
The Templar turns to the patriarch and tells him hypothetically that a Christian child was raised by a Jew. He seeks his advice and asks what he should do. The patriarch informs him that the Jew in question should be burned at the stake for inciting apostasy. The Templar then goes to Saladin, who is receiving Nathan's money, thanks him for his life and swears allegiance to him. He then tells Saladin, somewhat angrily, that Recha was raised as a Jewess and asks him to summon her. After he has left, Saladin asks his sister Sittah to bring her to him.
In the meantime, Nathan meets the monk, who confesses to him that it was he who, eighteen years earlier, gave him the child whose mother had died and who was entrusted to him by her military father, Wolf of Filnek, before he left for Gaza and died near Ascalon. The monk did not share the patriarch's anger, arguing that a father's love at a young age was more useful than Christianity. After all, Christianity is based on Judaism and Jesus himself was a Jew. Nathan recounts that shortly before his encounter with the monk, eighteen years earlier, Christians had killed his wife and seven children. When his anger at the Christians had subsided, however, he accepted the girl as having been sent by God to replace his seven dead children. Nathan assumes that the girl's mother was a von Stauffen and that her uncle was Konrad von Stauffen, the Templar's father. The monk sets off in search of a book in which the girl's relatives were listed.
Act Five
Tax money finally arrives from Egypt to fill Saladin's treasury. In the meantime, the Templar acknowledges that Nathan has taken good care of Recha and brought her up well, and regrets having spoken to the patriarch. The monk gives Nathan the book with the names of Recha's true relatives and tells him that the Templar has betrayed him to the Patriarch. Nathan then meets the Templar, who confesses to having spoken to the patriarch, begs Nathan's forgiveness and asks him for his daughter's hand in marriage, whether Jewish or Christian. Nathan replies that it is too late, that he has now found Recha's brother and that he will therefore take care of her and decide who the girl should marry.
They both then go to Recha, who is staying with Sittah. In the meantime, Recha complains to Sittah about her fate and about Daja, who, although she has always loved her like a mother, describes Christianity as the only true faith, the only way to God, and feels obliged to lead all those who do not follow her down this path. Recha tells Sittah that Daja has confirmed to her that she was born a Christian and that Nathan is not her father. Saladin arrives and tells her that blood does not make the father, but that it would be better for her if she found a husband, and calls Nathan and the Templar to him. Nathan begins to talk and says that the Templar's name is not Curd von Stauffen, but Leu von Filnek. His mother was a von Stauffen, as was his uncle, Curd von Stauffen. His father, however, Wolf von Filnek, was a friend of Nathan and also the father of Recha, whose real name is Blanda von Filnek. Incidentally, their father was not German, but Persian, and Saladin, who recognizes Filnek's handwriting in the breviary, identifies him as his brother Assad. The work ends with the reunited family embracing.
Review
Outstanding aspects
The "Ring Parable" as a central symbol: A centerpiece of the drama and undoubtedly one of the outstanding features of the play is the Ring Parable, which Nathan tells to illustrate the question of "true" religion. This parable, which tells a story about a ring that has the ability to be loved by God, becomes the central symbol for the equivalence of all religions.
Masterful characterization: Lessing masters the art of characterization with great finesse. Nathan, the Templar, the Sultan and other minor characters are profoundly developed and possess a psychological depth that makes their actions and motivations authentic and comprehensible. The dialog in the play is concise, perceptive and often of an emotional intensity that brings the philosophical ideas to life.
Writing style
Lessing's writing style in "Nathan the Wise" is characterized by clarity and precision. He uses blank verse to create a flowing but structured form that gives space to both the philosophical discourse and the emotional outbursts of the characters. His style allows complex ideas and arguments to be made accessible, making the play an important educational as well as entertaining work.
Strengths and weaknesses
Strengths: One of the play's greatest strengths is its timeless message of religious tolerance and the humanist ideal. Lessing's ability to weave deep philosophical and ethical questions within a compelling plot makes "Nathan the Wise" a masterpiece of didactic literature. In addition, the drama's intelligent dialog and the moral dilemmas of the characters provide ample material for discussion and reflection.
Weaknesses: Due to its didactic nature and focus on dialog and monologues over action, the play may be less appealing to some readers who prefer a more action-packed or plot-driven narrative. The highly idealized portrayal of tolerance and reason could also be perceived as unrealistic, especially in the context of today's social and religious conflicts.
Recommendations for reader types
"Nathan the Wise" is ideal for readers who are interested in literature with strong philosophical and ethical considerations. It is particularly suitable for people who are interested in questions of religion, morality and human coexistence.
The play is also excellent for academic study, especially in the fields of philosophy, ethics, religion and literature. It is less suitable for those looking for light entertainment, as the drama requires an in-depth examination of its themes.

In summary, "Nathan the Wise" is a powerful and thought-provoking work that is not only considered a literary masterpiece, but also an urgent appeal for tolerance and understanding in an increasingly polarized world.
