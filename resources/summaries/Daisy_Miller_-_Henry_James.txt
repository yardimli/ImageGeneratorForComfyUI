Daisy Miller
Henry James

"Daisy Miller" by Henry James is a classic novella that explores the clash between American innocence and European social convention. The story follows Frederick Winterbourne, a sophisticated American expatriate, who becomes captivated by the charmingly unconventional and free-spirited young American, Daisy Miller. Their interactions in the fashionable resorts of Switzerland and the high society of Rome highlight the tragic consequences of cultural misunderstandings and rigid social judgment.
Summary
Frederick Winterbourne, a 27-year-old American gentleman who has long resided in Geneva, is visiting his snobbish, elderly aunt, Mrs. Costello, in the Swiss resort town of Vevey. One day at his hotel, he encounters Randolph C. Miller, a brash American boy, and is soon joined by the boy's older sister, Annie "Daisy" Miller. Winterbourne is immediately struck by Daisy's exceptional beauty and her frank, unguarded manner of conversation, which is starkly at odds with the reserved behavior expected of young, unmarried women in European high society. Puzzled by her openness, he debates whether she is a calculating coquette or simply an innocent girl unfamiliar with social rules, ultimately deciding she is a "pretty American flirt." Fascinated, he agrees to her spontaneous suggestion that he take her on a visit to the nearby Chateau de Chillon.
Mrs. Costello, who considers the Millers "very common," refuses to meet Daisy and warns her nephew that his long absence from America has made him naive. Undeterred, Winterbourne proceeds with the excursion. He is charmed by Daisy's easy chatter but notes her complete lack of interest in the castle's history, as she lives entirely in the present. The trip is unchaperoned, a fact that Winterbourne finds odd but which seems of no concern to Daisy or her vague, ineffectual mother. Before Winterbourne leaves for Geneva, Daisy makes him promise to visit her when her family spends the winter in Rome.
When Winterbourne arrives in Rome several months later, he finds that Daisy has become the subject of scandal among the American expatriate community. He learns from his aunt and another society matron, Mrs. Walker, that Daisy is openly associating with Italian gentlemen, particularly a handsome man named Mr. Giovanelli. One afternoon, Winterbourne finds Daisy preparing to walk to the Pincian Gardens alone with Giovanelli. Both he and Mrs. Walker are shocked by this breach of decorum. Mrs. Walker intercepts them in her carriage, begging Daisy to get in to avoid being seen alone with two men. Daisy, seeing no harm in her actions, cheerfully refuses, stating, "If this is improper, Mrs. Walker, then I am all improper, and you must give me up." Horrified, Mrs. Walker abandons her, and Winterbourne reluctantly sides with Mrs. Walker, leaving Daisy with her Italian companion.
Daisy's social fate is sealed a few days later at Mrs. Walker's party. She arrives hours late, on the arm of Mr. Giovanelli, and is met with a cold reception from her hostess. After this public snub, Daisy is ostracized by the American social circle. Winterbourne continues to see her, torn between his attraction and his disapproval of her behavior, which he believes is ruining her reputation. He confronts her in the ruins of the Palace of the Caesars, where she first tells him she is engaged to Giovanelli, then quickly retracts it, leaving him more confused than ever.
A week later, Winterbourne is walking through the Colosseum late at night, a place considered dangerously unhealthy due to "Roman fever" (malaria). There, he discovers Daisy sitting with Giovanelli. Seeing her in such a compromising and perilous situation, Winterbourne concludes that she is not a respectable girl worth his concern. He coldly admonishes her for being in a place known to be a "nest of malaria." Hurt by his harsh judgment, Daisy departs.
Shortly thereafter, Daisy falls gravely ill with the fever. Before she dies, she sends a message to Winterbourne via her mother, insisting that she was never engaged to Giovanelli and that she cared about Winterbourne's opinion of her. At her funeral, a grieving Giovanelli tells Winterbourne that Daisy was "the most beautiful, likable, and innocent" person he had ever known. Haunted by guilt, Winterbourne returns to his life in Geneva, finally understanding that he had badly misjudged Daisy's innocent nature and that his failure to stand by her may have contributed to her tragic fate.
