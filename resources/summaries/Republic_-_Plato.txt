Republic
Plato

"Republic" by the philosopher Plato is a foundational work of Western philosophy that, through the character of his teacher Socrates, explores the nature of justice and the ideal state. The dialogue seeks to answer the question of whether the just person is happier than the unjust person by constructing a perfect city in theory, examining justice on a large scale before applying it to the individual soul. The work is not about a representative government but an ideal state or civil society, and its far-reaching discussion covers morality, politics, metaphysics, and education.
Summary
The dialogue begins as the philosopher Socrates and Plato's brother, Glaucon, are returning to Athens from a religious festival in the port city of Piraeus. They are invited to the home of Cephalus, where a conversation on justice begins. Polemarchus, a merchant's son, suggests that justice is giving people what they are owed, which he refines to mean helping one's friends and harming one's enemies. Socrates argues that since justice is a virtue, it cannot involve harming anyone, leading Polemarchus to concede his definition is inadequate.
The discussion is aggressively interrupted by Thrasymachus, a teacher of rhetoric, who declares that justice is nothing more than the interest of the stronger. He argues that rulers create laws to benefit themselves and that injustice, when practiced skillfully on a large scale, brings power, wealth, and happiness. Socrates challenges this view, arguing that the true goal of life is not power but happiness, which comes from a well-ordered soul. He argues Thrasymachus into submission but remains unsatisfied, as the true nature of justice has not yet been defined.
In Books 2-4, Plato’s brothers Glaucon and Adeimantus challenge Socrates to prove that justice is desirable for its own sake, not just for the rewards it brings. To do this, Socrates suggests they examine justice in a state, which is like the individual "writ large". He first describes a simple, healthy city based on necessity, which Glaucon dismisses as a "community of pigs". Socrates then elaborates on a more luxurious city, which would require a larger territory and thus a class of professional warriors, or guardians, to protect it.
The education of these guardians is paramount. Socrates proposes strict censorship of art and literature, forbidding stories that portray the gods in a negative light or show them causing evil. Their education must balance physical training with music and the arts to create harmony in the soul. The most promising students will be selected to become rulers, while the others will be their helpers, or auxiliaries. The guardians will live a communal life, owning no private property and having all their needs met by the other citizens. This society is divided into three classes based on talent: rulers (representing reason), auxiliary guardians (representing spirit), and workers (representing appetite). Justice in the state is achieved when each class performs its function without interfering with the others. Socrates then applies this model to the individual soul, which also has three parts: reason, spirit (emotions), and appetite (desires). A just person is one in whom reason, supported by spirit, governs the appetites.
In Books 5-7, Socrates outlines the more radical features of the ideal state. Women who have the ability will be educated alongside men and share in guardian duties. The guardian class will have no traditional families; mating will be arranged by the rulers, and children will be raised communally, so that their loyalty is to the state as a whole. Socrates claims this city is possible on one condition: philosophers must become kings. This is because only philosophers can apprehend the eternal, unchanging "Forms"—the perfect archetypes of which the physical world is a mere reflection—and can distinguish true reality from mere appearances. The ultimate goal of their knowledge is the "Form of the Good," which Socrates compares to the sun, the source of light that makes all sight and knowledge possible.
To illustrate the philosopher's journey, Socrates tells the Allegory of the Cave. He asks his listeners to imagine prisoners chained in a cave, able to see only shadows cast on a wall by a fire behind them. They believe these shadows are reality. If a prisoner were freed and dragged out into the sunlight, he would be blinded and confused at first, but would eventually see the real world and understand that the sun is the source of all things. This enlightened person, the philosopher, would recognize that power and prestige are mere shadows and would feel an obligation to return to the cave to free the other prisoners, even at great personal risk. The education of the philosopher-king is therefore a long ascent from ignorance to knowledge, involving years of study in mathematics and dialectic (logical reasoning), followed by 15 years of practical political training. At age 50, they are ready to rule, accepting it as a duty rather than a privilege.
In Book 8, Socrates describes the four types of corrupt states that arise from the decay of the ideal city. The first is a timocracy, based on honor, where the spirited part of the soul rules. This degenerates into an oligarchy, or rule by the wealthy, where the love of money dominates. The growing gap between rich and poor leads to a revolution, establishing a democracy, where a love of absolute liberty leads to a lack of order and discipline. This state of anarchy makes it easy for a single, powerful figure to seize control, resulting in the worst form of government: tyranny.
In Book 9, Socrates paints a portrait of the tyrannical man to prove that the just life is the happiest. He explains that all people have lawless desires, but in a well-ordered soul, they are controlled by reason. In the tyrant, these appetites rule completely, making him a slave to his passions. He is friendless, paranoid, and incapable of experiencing true pleasure, which only comes from a soul governed by reason. The tyrant is therefore the most unjust and most miserable of all men.
In Book 10, Socrates returns to the topic of art, arguing that poets and artists should be banned from the ideal state. He claims they create images that are twice removed from reality (a painting of a bed is a copy of a physical bed, which is itself a copy of the eternal "Form" of a bed) and that their work appeals to the lower, emotional part of the soul, undermining reason. Only hymns to the gods and praises of great men should be allowed. Socrates then argues for the immortality of the soul, stating that if a thing is not destroyed by its own specific evil—and the soul's evil is injustice—then it cannot be destroyed at all. To illustrate the rewards of justice after death, he recounts the Legend of Er, a soldier who dies, travels to the afterlife, and returns to tell what he saw. Souls are judged, with the just sent to a heavenly reward and the unjust to a place of punishment. After a period of time, the souls come before the Fates to choose their next life. After they choose, they drink from the River of Forgetfulness and are reborn. Er’s story serves as a final testament that the just life is the best and most rewarding path, both in this world and the next.
