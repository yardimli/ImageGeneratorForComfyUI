Beowulf
unknown


The Old English epic poem "Beowulf" is the most important surviving single work in the Anglo-Saxon language. In 3182 verses, it describes the heroic deeds of the eponymous protagonist Beowulf. The work consists of three main parts in which Beowulf fights various enemies: the monster Grendel (a monstrous descendant of Cain), Grendel's mother and finally a dragon. The story is set in Scandinavia and conveys a comprehensive picture of the cultural values and traditions of the Germanic peoples during the early Anglo-Saxon period. "Beowulf" is not only a heroic story, but also a profound reflection on heroism, ethics and the human experience in the face of life and death.
Summary
Part 1: Beowulf and Grendel
"Beowulf" begins with the construction of the great hall Heorot by Hrothgar, who builds it as a meeting place for himself and his warriors. Here, Hrothgar, his wife Wealhtheow and their warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. But the sounds of joy torment Grendel, a troll-like monster and descendant of the biblical Cain. Grendel then attacks Heorot, killing and consuming many of the warriors sleeping there. Helpless in the face of Grendel, Hrothgar and his people withdraw from the hall.
Beowulf, an aspiring warrior from Geatland, learns of these events. With his king's blessing, he sets off to help Hrothgar. Beowulf and his entourage spend a night in Heorot, where Beowulf insists on remaining unarmed as he feels equal to Grendel. When Grendel appears, Beowulf feigns sleep, jumps up and grabs the monster by the hand. A fierce battle breaks out while Beowulf's companions try in vain to wound Grendel with their swords. In the end, Beo-wulf succeeds in tearing off Grendel's arm at the shoulder. The badly injured Grendel flees into the marshes, where he dies. Beowulf presents the monster's arm and shoulder to Heorot, an act that evokes the wrath and vengeance of Grendel's mother.
Part 2: Beowulf and Grendel's mother
After celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men rest in the great hall of Heorot. But the rest is short-lived: Grendel's mother, driven by rage at the death of her son, attacks and violently kills Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, Aeschere, and escapes.
Hrothgar, Beowulf and their companions pursue Grendel's mother to her lair, which is located beneath a lake. Unferth, once a rival of Beowulf, hands him his sword Hrunting to express his support. Before jumping into the lake, Beowulf makes conditions in the event of his death, including caring for his relatives and passing on his inheritance to Unferth. He then plunges into the depths and, beset by water monsters, fights his way to the bottom, where he comes across a cave. Grendel's mother pulls him in and a fierce battle breaks out between them.
She throws Beowulf to the ground, sits on him and tries to kill him with a short sword. But Beowulf's armor protects him from the deadly attack. In a moment of defense, Beowulf discovers a huge sword on the wall, grabs it and decapitates Grendel's mother with it. As he penetrates deeper into the cave, Beowulf comes across Grendel's corpse and cuts off his head with a single blow. The blade of the sword melts in the monster's hot blood, leaving only the hilt behind.
Beowulf returns through the water to the shore of the lake, where his men are waiting for him. He brings the sword hilt and Grendel's head with him and presents them to Hrothgar on his return to Heorot. Hrothgar rewards Beowulf generously, including with the sword Naegling, a family heirloom. These events lead to a detailed reflection by the king, which is often referred to as 'Hrothgar's sermon'. In it, he warns Beowulf to beware of arrogance and to take his responsibility seriously.
Part 3: Beowulf and the dragon
After his return to his people, Beowulf rises to become king. Half a century after his confrontation with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from a dragon's cave in Earnanaes. The dragon, furious at the loss, leaves his cave and starts a devastating fire that destroys everything in its path. Beowulf and his warriors prepare to fight the dragon. But Beowulf decides that he will face the challenge alone and orders his men to wait on the burial mound.
However, Beowulf is outmatched in the battle with the dragon. When his men realize the danger and fear for their lives, they flee into the forest. Only Wiglaf, one of his loyal warriors, rushes to his aid full of concern. Together they manage to kill the dragon, but Beowulf suffers fatal injuries. After Beowulf's death, Wiglaf remains by his side, grieving. When the other warriors return, Wiglaf criticizes them severely and blames their cowardice for Beowulf's death.
Beowulf is ritually burned on a large pyre in Geatland, while his people remain in deep mourning, worried that they are now at the mercy of attacks from neighboring tribes without his protection. A burial mound, high enough to be visible from the sea, is erected in Beowulf's memory.
