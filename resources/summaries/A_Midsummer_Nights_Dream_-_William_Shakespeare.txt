A Midsummer Nightâ€™s Dream
William Shakespeare

"A Midsummer Night's Dream" by William Shakespeare is one of the playwright's most popular and whimsical comedies. The play masterfully intertwines three distinct worlds: the courtly realm of Athenian nobles, the magical forest inhabited by fairies, and the bumbling world of amateur actors. The story follows the chaotic and humorous misadventures of four young lovers, a troupe of craftsmen, and the fairies whose magical meddling complicates and ultimately resolves the human drama, exploring themes of love, illusion, and the nature of reality itself.
Summary
In ancient Athens, Duke Theseus is preparing to marry Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Their plans are interrupted by the nobleman Egeus, who demands that his daughter Hermia marry Demetrius. Hermia, however, is in love with Lysander. Theseus gives Hermia an ultimatum: marry Demetrius, face death, or become a nun. To escape this fate, Hermia and Lysander plan to elope, meeting in the woods outside the city. They confide in Hermia's friend, Helena, who is desperately in love with Demetrius. Hoping to win his affection, Helena decides to reveal the lovers' plan to Demetrius. Meanwhile, a group of local craftsmen, including the weaver Nick Bottom, are preparing to perform a play about Pyramus and Thisbe for the Duke's wedding, and they agree to rehearse in the same woods.
In the forest, Oberon, King of the Fairies, is feuding with his queen, Titania, over a changeling boy she refuses to give him. To get his revenge, Oberon sends his mischievous servant, Puck, to find a magical flower whose juice, when placed on a sleeping person's eyelids, will make them fall in love with the first creature they see upon waking. After witnessing Demetrius cruelly reject Helena in the woods, Oberon instructs Puck to use the potion on the "disdainful Athenian youth" so he will fall for Helena.
Oberon anoints the sleeping Titania's eyes with the love potion. Puck, however, stumbles upon the sleeping Lysander and Hermia and, mistaking Lysander for Demetrius, applies the potion to his eyes. Helena, abandoned by Demetrius, wanders by and wakes Lysander, who instantly falls madly in love with her. Helena, believing she is being mocked, runs away with Lysander in pursuit. Hermia awakens to find herself alone and frightened.
The craftsmen arrive in the forest to rehearse their play. Puck, observing them, magically transforms Bottom's head into that of an ass. His terrified companions flee, leaving Bottom alone. Titania is awakened by his singing and, under the spell's influence, immediately falls in love with the ass-headed weaver, doting on him with her fairy attendants.
Puck reports his success to Oberon, but they soon realize he has enchanted the wrong Athenian. When Demetrius falls asleep, Oberon applies the potion to his eyes. Puck brings Helena back, still followed by Lysander. Demetrius awakens, sees Helena, and also falls in love with her. The situation descends into chaos as both men now pursue a bewildered and angry Helena, while Hermia arrives and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander's love. The four lovers quarrel bitterly. To prevent a duel between Lysander and Demetrius, Oberon has Puck create a thick fog to separate them and then applies an antidote to Lysander's eyes as he sleeps.
Having obtained the changeling boy from a distracted Titania, Oberon releases her from the spell and has Puck restore Bottom's head. As dawn breaks, Theseus, Hippolyta, and Egeus discover the four lovers sleeping in the forest. They awaken, their memories of the night feeling like a strange dream. Demetrius now truly loves Helena, so Theseus overrules Egeus and declares that both couples shall be married alongside him and Hippolyta. Bottom awakens alone, puzzled by his "dream," and rushes to rejoin his friends for their performance.
That evening, at the triple wedding feast, the newlyweds watch the craftsmen's comically inept performance of "Pyramus and Thisbe." After the mortals retire to bed, Oberon, Titania, and their fairy retinue enter to bless the house and the new marriages. Puck is left alone to address the audience, suggesting that if they were offended by the play, they should simply remember it as a dream.
