The Picture of Dorian Gray
Oscar Wilde


"The Picture of Dorian Gray" is the only novel by the Irish writer Oscar Wilde. It tells the story of the young and attractive Dorian Gray, who, under the influence of the cynical Lord Henry, makes a dangerous wish that comes true: Dorian's youth and beauty are to be preserved, while a painted portrait of him is to record all his sins and the signs of ageing. This work is considered one of the central narratives of aestheticism and Gothic fiction and offers a sharp critique of the morals of Victorian society.
Summary
On a bright summer's day in Victorian England, Lord Henry Wotton, known for his firm convictions, observes the sensitive painter Basil Hallward as he paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. The attractive young man is the perfect source of inspiration for Basil. As Dorian models, he witnesses Lord Henry extolling his hedonistic views on life and begins to embrace the idea that beauty is the only goal worth striving for in life. He wishes that the painting would age in his place.
Under the seductive influence of Lord Henry, Dorian immerses himself in the world of sensuality. He becomes aware of the actress Sibyl Vane, who is performing Shakespeare's plays in an inconspicuous theater. He falls in love with her, courts her and proposes to her. Sibyl is overjoyed, but her fraternally concerned brother James threatens to kill Dorian if he harms his sister.
Dorian asks Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl's performance in "Romeo and Juliet". But Sibyl, who is too in love to play her role convincingly, fails on stage. Basil and Lord Henry suspect that Dorian's interest in Sibyl is only in her outward beauty, not her talent. Humiliated, Dorian breaks with Sibyl and tells her that her artistry is the only thing that interests him about her. Without this, he is indifferent to her. When he returns home, he notices that his portrait has changed: his wish has been granted and the face on the painting now bears a slightly cruel smile.
Overwhelmed by the weight of guilt and loneliness, Dorian decides to reconnect with Sibyl. But Lord Henry informs him that Sibyl has taken her own life. At that moment, Dorian realizes that only pleasure and beauty count for him in life. He locks away the changing portrait and spends the following eighteen years exploring all sorts of vices, guided by a morally corrupting French novel that Lord Henry has given him.
One evening, shortly before setting off on a trip to Paris, Basil visits Dorian to confront him about the rumors circulating about his dissolute life. Dorian does not deny his transgressions and leads Basil to the portrait, which has now been transformed into a repulsive likeness and can only be identified by Basil's signature. Basil is deeply shocked and desperately urges Dorian to pray for forgiveness. Dorian becomes furious, blames Basil for his misdeed and finally stabs him to death. Dorian then blackmails Alan Campbell, a former friend and scientist, to use his chemical expertise to dispose of Basil Hallward's body. Alan then commits suicide.
To escape responsibility for his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, unaware that James Vane is also there. James, who is seeking revenge for Sibyl's suicide, has so far had no way of tracking Dorian down, as he only knew the name Sibyl gave him: "Prince Charming". In the gloomy opium den, however, James hears someone addressing Dorian by that very name.
James confronts Dorian, who pretends to be far too young to have known Sibyl, who died eighteen years ago. Dorian remains unchanged in his youthful appearance. James is confused and lets Dorian go. But a woman from the opium den points out to James that it is in fact Dorian Gray and emphasizes that he has not aged in the last eighteen years. James realizes his mistake and hurries after Dorian, but he has already disappeared.
As a result, James begins to pursue Dorian, which puts Dorian in constant fear for his life. But fate takes an unexpected turn when James is mistakenly shot by a hunter during a hunting party while lying in wait in the bushes.
On his return to London, Dorian informs Lord Henry that he has decided to lead a virtuous life from now on. As a first step, he deliberately does not want to break the heart of his naive lover Hetty Merton. Hoping that his newfound morality may have removed the depravity in the portrait, he looks at it again, only to see an even more hideous image of himself. Dorian realizes that his motives for the moral transformation into reality were driven by vanity and curiosity, combined with a desire to restore the painting to its original beautiful state.
In a desperate act, Dorian decides that only the complete destruction of the painting, the last witness to his crimes, can free him from his guilt. In a rage, he stabs the portrait with the knife he once used to murder Basil. The servants hear a scream from the locked room, as does a passer-by in the street, who alerts the police.
When the servants break into the room, they discover a disfigured old man, stabbed, withered and frail. They can only identify the body as Dorian by the rings on his fingers. Next to him lies his portrait, as beautiful as ever.
