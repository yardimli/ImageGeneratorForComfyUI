Light in August
William Faulkner
"Light in August" by William Faulkner is a profound exploration of identity, race, and belonging set in the fictional town of Jefferson, Mississippi. The novel weaves together multiple storylines that intersect around themes of isolation, violence, and redemption in the American South. Through the tragic figure of Joe Christmas, a man of uncertain racial heritage, and the hopeful journey of Lena Grove, an unmarried pregnant woman, Faulkner examines the destructive power of racial prejudice and the possibility of human connection amidst social alienation. The work stands as one of Faulkner's masterpieces, combining lyrical prose with unflinching social commentary.
Summary
The novel opens with Lena Grove, a pregnant and unmarried white woman from Alabama, traveling to Mississippi in search of Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. After four weeks on the road, she arrives at the outskirts of Jefferson, where smoke rises from a burning house—unknown to her, this is the home of Joanna Burden, a white woman who lies murdered inside.
At the local sawmill, Lena discovers that the man she seeks is not "Burch" but Byron Bunch, a quiet white mill worker who has lived in Jefferson for seven years while keeping largely to himself. Immediately drawn to Lena, Byron takes her to his boarding house where his landlady provides her shelter. Byron's only acquaintance in town is the Reverend Gail Hightower, a disgraced former Presbyterian minister who has isolated himself from the community after his obsession with his grandfather's Civil War death drove his wife to suicide.
As Jefferson erupts in rumors about the murder, the townspeople focus their suspicions on Joe Christmas, a man believed to be "part Negro" who had recently arrived in town. Byron realizes that Joe Christmas's business partner, "Joe Brown," is actually Lucas Burch using an alias, making him the father of Lena's child.
The narrative then delves into Joe Christmas's tragic past through extensive flashbacks. Born to Milly Hines, a white woman who died in childbirth, Joe's father was a dark-skinned circus performer believed to have "Negro" blood. Milly's father, Eupheus "Doc" Hines, killed the circus performer in rage and abandoned the infant Joe at an orphanage at Christmas time, hence his surname. Throughout Joe's childhood at the orphanage, old Doc Hines worked there as a janitor, secretly watching the boy and spreading rumors about his mixed race heritage.
At thirteen, Joe was adopted by Simon McEachern, a harsh, puritanical white farmer whose strict discipline bred resentment in the boy. Mrs. McEachern attempted to compensate for her husband's severity with secret kindness, bringing Joe food and money. At seventeen, Joe began his first sexual relationship with Bobbie Allen, a white waitress twice his age who was secretly a prostitute. Joe would sneak out nightly to visit her, giving her money and planning a future together.
When McEachern discovered the relationship, he followed Joe to a dance and confronted Bobbie, calling her a "harlot." Joe struck McEachern down, believing he had killed him, then rushed home to steal money before returning to collect Bobbie for their planned elopement. Instead, he found her with Max Confrey, her employer, along with a blonde woman named Marne and a stranger. The group, all involved in prostitution, robbed and abandoned Joe, leaving him with a permanent distrust of women.
For fifteen years, Joe wandered aimlessly across the country, working odd jobs and seeking revenge against white women through relationships with prostitutes, taking perverse pleasure in revealing his suspected mixed heritage. At thirty-three, he arrived in Jefferson, penniless and desperate. Breaking into Joanna Burden's house for food, he discovered her sexual attraction to him and decided to stay, viewing their relationship as an opportunity to "get even" with white women.
Joanna Burden, a middle-aged spinster dedicated to helping African Americans, felt obligated to assist Joe because of her family's belief that slavery had cursed all white people. Her father, Calvin Burden, had instilled in her a mission to help remove this curse through service to the black community. However, Joanna's attraction to Joe was intensely sexual and violent—having been a virgin for over forty years, she responded to him with animalistic passion, screaming "Negro! Negro!" during their encounters.
Joe moved into the cabin behind Joanna's house, working briefly at the mill before turning to bootlegging whiskey from Memphis. He partnered with "Joe Brown" (Lucas Burch), inviting him to share the cabin. Brown became the only person in town aware of Joe's sexual relationship with Joanna.
As time passed, Joanna's conscience began to trouble her. Increasingly alarmed by her sexual "corruption" and Joe's criminal activities, she decided to "redeem" both herself and Joe through prayer and by training him to help educate local black residents. When Joe rejected these proposals as futile, Joanna declared that "it might be better if they both were dead." She loaded an old pistol with two bullets and aimed it at Joe, but the weapon misfired. In automatic self-defense, Joe attacked her with a straight razor, cutting her throat and nearly decapitating her before fleeing the house, which later burned.
Following the discovery of Joanna's body, her relatives in New Hampshire offered a $1,000 reward for the killer's capture. Joe Brown, eager for the money, blamed Joe Christmas for the murder. The sheriff organized a posse with bloodhounds to track Joe, but the exhausted fugitive was not captured until he wandered into Mottstown.
Among Mottstown's residents were old Doc Hines and his wife. When Doc Hines saw Joe, he screamed for a lynching, raving like a maniac until he collapsed. Mrs. Hines, trying to understand her husband's extreme reaction, suspected that Joe might be their late daughter's illegitimate son—their grandson they had never met.
Joe was transferred to the Jefferson jail, followed by Mrs. Hines and her now eerily docile husband. The next morning, Byron informed Hightower of Joe's capture, later bringing the Hineses to the minister's house. Mrs. Hines revealed what she knew of the family history, explaining that she had come to Jefferson to prevent her husband from participating in Joe's lynching. She begged Hightower to provide Joe with an alibi by claiming he had been with him the night of the murder, but Hightower refused to participate in the lie and ordered them from his house.
The following morning found Lena in labor at Brown's cabin, attended by Mrs. Hines. Byron had brought her there as part of his plan to trap the elusive Lucas Burch, who was being held at the jail until Joe's indictment. Byron summoned Hightower to help with the birth while he went for a doctor. The baby—a boy—was delivered with only Hightower and Mrs. Hines assisting. In the chaos of the delivery, Mrs. Hines became confused and began calling the newborn "Joey," mistaking him for her late daughter's son, Joe Christmas. The birth reminded Hightower of a previous occasion when he had helped deliver a black child and was suspected of being the father.
As Hightower walked home afterward, he reflected on his reactions to Lena's childbirth and marveled that he had participated in life once again after years of isolation.
With Joe planning to plead guilty, Joe Brown became useless to the sheriff's investigation. The sheriff agreed to participate in Byron's plan to confront Brown with Lena and their child, hoping to see justice served. A deputy escorted Brown to the cabin where he was stunned to see Lena and his newborn son. As expected, Brown immediately deserted them again, sneaking out a back window and fleeing. Byron pursued him, but Brown knocked him down and escaped by hopping a freight train.
Meanwhile, Joe managed to escape while being transported for his indictment. He ran to a "Negro cabin" where he acquired a gun, but was soon discovered hiding in Hightower's kitchen by Percy Grimm, a savage, racist twenty-five-year-old volunteer in the state national guard. In a desperate attempt to save Joe's life, Hightower falsely claimed that Joe had been with him the night of the murder. But Grimm, determined to carry out his own brand of justice, shot Joe and then castrated him with a butcher knife while he was still alive. Joe seemed to collapse inward and died with "his eyes open... peaceful."
Hightower later emerged from his long "retirement" to preside over Joe's funeral service. Everyone speculated about Joe's reasons for choosing Hightower's house as a hideout. District attorney Gavin Stevens suggested that Mrs. Hines was partially responsible for the choice—deeply moved by the birth of Lena's son, she had apparently visited Joe in jail to reveal an escape plan, telling him that Hightower could save him and giving him the courage to attempt escape.
In his final moments of reflection, Hightower glanced back into his memory and found himself able to see a pattern connecting his past with recent events. Ready for death, he achieved a peaceful state similar to Joe's final moments, experiencing tranquility for the first time in his life.
Three weeks later, a furniture repairman traveling the road picked up three hitchhikers: Byron, Lena, and her baby. He gave them a ride until sundown, then stopped to camp for the night. When Lena rejected Byron's sexual advances, claiming he might wake the baby, Byron temporarily abandoned her in frustration. However, he was found the next morning waiting beyond the curve of the road to be picked up again, demonstrating his commitment to her and the child.
The repairman dropped them off near the state line and returned home, while the three travelers continued toward Tennessee. Upon reaching the border, Lena observed, "My, my. A body does get around. Here we ain't been coming from Alabama but two months, and now it's already Tennessee." These final words echo her statement from the novel's opening: "Here I ain't been on the road but four weeks, and now I am in Jefferson already. My, my. A body does get around," suggesting the cyclical nature of her journey and the continuity of life despite the violence and tragedy that had unfolded in Jefferson.Add to Conversation
