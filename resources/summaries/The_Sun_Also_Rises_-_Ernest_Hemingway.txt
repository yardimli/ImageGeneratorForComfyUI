The Sun Also Rises
Ernest Hemingway
"The Sun Also Rises" by Ernest Hemingway is a seminal work of the "Lost Generation," capturing the disillusionment and aimlessness of a group of American and British expatriates in Europe after World War I. The novel follows the narrator, Jake Barnes, an American journalist rendered impotent by a war wound, as he navigates his hopeless love for the promiscuous Lady Brett Ashley. Set against the backdrop of the vibrant nightlife of 1920s Paris and the visceral energy of the bullfighting fiesta in Pamplona, Spain, the story is a profound exploration of love, masculinity, the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, and the contrast between the superficiality of modern life and the enduring, natural values of the earth.

Summary
Robert Cohn, a restless young American writer living in Paris, represents a generation of expatriates seeking meaning after World War I. In the spring of 1924, Cohn, bored of his life and his lover, Frances, plans to travel to South America. His friend Jake Barnes, the narrator and an American journalist, advises against it, arguing that travel won't cure his restlessness. Cohn is only convinced to stay in Paris after meeting the beautiful and promiscuous Lady Brett Ashley at a dance hall.
Cohn falls in love with Brett, but she leaves with Jake. Brett and Jake share a deep but unconsummated love, a result of a war wound that has left Jake impotent. They kiss passionately in a taxi but know their relationship can't be physical. At a bar, they meet Count Mippipopolous, a wealthy Greek who is attracted to Brett. Jake returns home, frustrated by his impotence and the frivolous Parisian nightlife. Brett later appears at his apartment, drunk and miserable, but leaves with the Count. The next day, Jake warns a disbelieving Cohn about Brett’s history with men. Later, they meet Frances, who bitterly complains that Cohn is leaving her. Jake then meets Brett, who is planning a trip to Spain.
Jake’s friend, the writer Bill Gorton, arrives in Paris, and they are joined by Brett and her fiancé, Mike Campbell, a bankrupt Scottish war veteran. The group plans a trip to Pamplona for the bullfights. Jake learns that Cohn had a brief, unsuccessful affair with Brett on her recent trip and still plans to join them in Spain. Jake and Bill travel ahead to Pamplona, where they meet Cohn. Learning that Brett and Mike are delayed, they decide to go fishing in the Pyrenees mountains, but Cohn stays behind to wait for Brett. The fishing trip is a time of peaceful friendship for Jake and Bill, far from the superficiality of Paris. However, news of Brett and Mike's arrival in Pamplona forces their return.
As Pamplona prepares for its annual fiesta, tension grows between Mike and Cohn. Mike, aware of Cohn's history with Brett, taunts him relentlessly, comparing him to a steer that stupidly follows Brett everywhere. Jake finds solace in the world of bullfighting, sharing his *afición* (passion) with the hotel manager, Montoya.
The fiesta begins on July 6, a week of non-stop drinking, parades, and fireworks. The group witnesses the "running of the bulls" and attends the bullfights, where they see the brilliant young bullfighter Pedro Romero. Brett is immediately attracted to the dashing Spaniard. Despite Montoya's warning to protect the young man from corrupting outsiders, Jake introduces Romero to Brett at her request. A frustrated and jealous Mike tries to fight Cohn but is stopped by Bill. Brett slips away and spends the night with Romero.
Later that night, Bill, Mike, and Jake are confronted by a furious Cohn, who demands to know where Brett is. When he learns she is with Romero, he calls Jake a pimp, and a fight breaks out. Cohn, a former boxing champion, knocks Jake unconscious and beats up Mike. He then storms Romero’s room and severely beats the bullfighter, but Romero’s refusal to admit defeat ultimately forces Cohn to retreat in shame. Filled with remorse, Cohn tries to apologize to Jake, but their friendship is over.
The next morning, Jake witnesses a man being gored to death during the running of the bulls. He finds Brett with Romero, who is recovering from the beating. She confesses she is madly in love with the 19-year-old bullfighter. That afternoon, the group, minus Cohn who has left in shame, attends the final bullfight. Though bruised, Romero performs brilliantly and presents the slaughtered bull’s ear to Brett as a token of his love. That night, as the fiesta ends, Brett and Romero leave Pamplona together.
With the fiesta over, the group disperses. Bill returns to the United States, Mike goes into hiding from his creditors, and Jake retreats to the Spanish coast to rest. His peace is interrupted by a telegram from Brett in Madrid, claiming to be in trouble. Jake rushes to her and finds that her affair with Romero has ended. Realizing she would only ruin the proud young man, she sent him away. The novel ends as it began, with Jake and Brett in a taxi, driving aimlessly through the night. Jake ironically agrees with Brett when she laments, "Oh, Jake, we could have had such a damned good time together," to which he replies, "Yes. Isn't it pretty to think so?"
