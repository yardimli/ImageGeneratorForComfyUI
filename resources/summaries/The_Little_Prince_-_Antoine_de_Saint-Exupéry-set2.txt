The Little Prince
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry


"The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is a lyrical and philosophical tale that masquerades as a children's book but offers profound insights for readers of all ages. This work tells the story of a young prince who travels to different planets and encounters different characters before landing on Earth. Each encounter reveals deeper truths about human nature and the importance of relationships.
Summary
The unnamed narrator begins his story by telling how he made his first drawing as a six-year-old. It was supposed to depict a giant snake digesting an elephant, but the adults only saw it as a hat and advised him to give up drawing. The narrator then adapted to the adult world, but felt lonely and misunderstood.
After an emergency landing of his plane in the Sahara, the narrator meets the little prince by chance, who asks him to draw him a sheep. Surprisingly, the little prince immediately recognizes the giant snake and the elephant in the drawing. After several unsuccessful attempts to draw a sheep, the narrator makes a drawing of a box and explains that the desired sheep is inside, whereupon the little prince is satisfied.
The little prince goes on to tell the narrator the stories of his journey to Earth. He comes from a small asteroid that is barely bigger than a house. On this small planet, the little prince was mainly busy tending his three volcanoes and removing the rampant baobabs to prevent them from overgrowing and destroying his planet. He needed a sheep to graze the baobabs before they grew too big and threatened his planet. The little prince lived there with a talking rose, which he nurtured and cared for before he left his planet.
In search of friendship, he traveled to neighboring asteroids, each inhabited by self-centered people isolated in their own world. In the process, he encountered various lonely figures:
•	a lonely old king who ruled over a fictional kingdom and treated the little prince as his subject; 
•	a vain man who, for no reason at all, desired only applause and admiration; 
•	a drunkard who drank to forget the shame of drinking; 
•	a businessman who spent his days counting the stars because he believed they belonged to him; 
•	a lamplighter who had to switch his planet's street lamp on and off every minute because the planet was spinning so fast; the little prince felt a certain admiration for this man because he was the only one who didn't think only of himself; 
•	a geographer who sat at his desk and wrote voluminous books which, much to the prince's chagrin, left out the really important things in life. He suggested that the little prince should visit the earth. 
So the little prince finally arrived on earth, where he first met a clever, well-meaning poisonous snake who offered to help him return to his planet. The little prince understood that this help would come in the form of a deadly bite, although the snake chose its words kindly but mysteriously.
On his further journey, he encountered a small flower, high peaks and finally a garden full of roses. The rose on his planet had told the little prince that it was the only one of its kind in the entire universe, so he was very disappointed at this discovery.
The little prince then crossed the desert in Africa and met a little fox who asked to be tamed and to be his friend. The fox spoke to the prince at length about friendship and revealed to him the secret of the deep bond between two beings: You only know the one you have tamed, and you are responsible for the one you have tamed for the rest of your life. The fox also shared a secret with him: You can only see well with your heart, and essential things are invisible to the eyes.
After hearing the little prince's story, the pilot fails to repair the plane and runs out of water. So they set off in search of a well. After a day's walk, the two wearily stop on a dune to admire the desert at night. With the sleeping child in his arms, the pilot crosses the desert all night and finally discovers the well at dawn, where they both drink happily. The little prince hints that he can return to his flower on his planet by dying and realizes that his flower is the only thing he really loves. He also admonishes the narrator to continue repairing his plane.
The pilot returns to his plane and repairs it. He then visits the fountain again and learns of the little prince's impending appointment with the poisonous snake to be bitten and return to his planet.
The little prince, aware that he has tamed the pilot, feels guilty and asks him to look up at the sky and remember him when he looks at the stars. After he says this, the snake bites him on the ankle and the little prince falls lifeless into the sand.
The next day, the pilot is unable to find the child's body and imagines that the little prince has managed to return to his planet and take care of his beloved rose.
