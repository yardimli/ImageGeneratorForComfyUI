Friedrich Schiller (November 10, 1759 - May 9, 1805)
Year of publication: 1781
Genre: drama

"The Robbers" by Friedrich Schiller is a rousing drama that is often regarded as one of the most important pieces of German Sturm und Drang literature. The play, which Schiller wrote in his youth, consists of five acts and deals with themes such as freedom, fraternal strife, betrayal, love and human nature. It tells the story of two brothers, Karl and Franz Moor, who are embroiled in a bitter struggle for power, inheritance and moral integrity. Karl, the older brother, is rejected by his father through the intrigues of his younger brother Franz and becomes the leader of a gang of robbers who rebel against corrupt society.
Summary
The story takes place over a period of about two years in Germany, between the castle in Franconia and the Bohemian Forest. The characters are introduced in the first scenes: the old Count Moor, his two sons Karl and Franz and Karl's mistress Amalia.
Franz immediately reveals his evil intentions: He wants to become master at all costs by taking by force the rights that nature has denied him as the second son. He therefore uses forged letters to make his father believe that Karl has dishonored the family name; old Moor is persuaded that it would be better not to forgive Karl straight away, but to let him go home. Franz, on the other hand, writes to his brother that he can never be forgiven.
In the second scene, we meet a group of revolutionary-minded young men who decide to become robbers. Although this idea comes from Spiegelberg, they all support Karl Moor as their leader. Spiegelberg, however, does not have what it takes to be a hero and harbors a grudge against Karl.
At the castle, Franz's plans continue: he fails to seduce Amalia and instead persuades a servant (Hermann) to appear in disguise to old Moor and deliver the news of Karl's supposed death. It seems that the grief over the loss of his son finally robs old Moor of the last of his strength, and Amalia believes she sees him dying. However, the servant bows to his conscience and reveals to Amalia that both Karl and old Moor are still alive. In fact, Franz has had his father locked in the tower to starve to death.
Meanwhile, in the Bohemian Forest, the robbers are rejoicing over their successful rescue of Roller from the gallows. As a distraction, they have blown up the town's powder magazine, causing many casualties. Karl chases Schufterle away from the group as he does not realize that Roller was saved at great sacrifice. At the same time, Karl manages to surround a group of soldiers to prove the bravery of his comrades. The soldiers send a monk to negotiate, but no agreement is reached. A fight ensues, which the robbers win.
The group is then joined by Kosinsky, an unfortunate young man with a similar story to Karl. He is also a nobleman and cannot control his fiefdom. His mistress, also called Amalia, has been taken away from him.
With Kosinsky's help, Karl enters the castle under a false identity and learns that Amalia still loves him, but also that his father is dead. Franz, however, recognizes his brother and forces a house servant (Daniel) to poison him; but the house servant also recognizes Karl and sides with him instead of administering the poison.
In the meantime, Schweizer has killed Spiegelberg because he was plotting against Karl. The tormented and hopeless Karl is on the verge of killing himself, but does not do so because he does not want bad luck to overtake him. It is at this point that one of the great twists occurs: Karl learns that his father is not dead, but has been locked up in a tower by his brother and is only alive because a servant took pity on him and brought him food. Karl wants revenge and sends his comrades out to capture his brother alive.
Franz, for his part, senses that his end is near and after a nightmare about the Last Judgement, he sends for the priest. The priest is certain that Franz will also invoke God's mercy in the face of death, but Franz has a different opinion. What worries him most, however, is the fact that, according to the priest, the two most serious sins are fratricide and patricide: He is so horrified and angry that he throws the priest out. In the meantime, the robbers set fire to the castle and the panicked Franz strangles himself with the rope of his hat just before he is caught. Schweizer, for his part, kills himself because he cannot bring Franz to his captain alive. Thanks to Franz's suicide, Karl is not stained with fraternal blood.
In the meantime, Karl talks to his father outside the castle. Old Moor does not know that it is his son Karl and does not fully bless him because he wants to kill Franz. Then comes the final drama: when Karl comes to Amalia, old Moor realizes that it is his son Karl, who is also the leader of the robbers. The shock of this realization is so great that old Moor does not survive it.
Karl initially seems to reject Amalia's love, as he believes he has made her unhappy. But when the misunderstandings clear up and the two find each other, the robbers intervene - not Karl's loyal followers, but other members of the gang. They demand the separation of the lovers, citing the captain's oath of allegiance. Amalia, who cannot bear to be abandoned again, asks to be killed. Karl initially refuses, but is forced to stab her to death when he realizes that another robber would otherwise do so.
After this tragic act, Karl's strength is broken and he suddenly realizes the reality: you can't dream of liberating the world by committing atrocities, because that would shake the whole edifice of civilized life to its foundations. In order to redeem himself in the eyes of God, to whom alone the right to revenge belongs, he places himself in his hands: he gives himself up to a child laborer so that he can redeem the bounty for him and use the money to provide for his family. Karl carries out this act in order to free himself from his evil companions.
Review
Outstanding aspects
Complex and profound character portrayal: Schiller's portrayal of the characters, especially the two brothers, is complex and profound. Karl Moor, as the tragic hero, struggles with his ideals of justice and freedom and the brutal realities of his actions. Franz, portrayed as a manipulative and power-hungry antagonist, represents the darker side of human ambition. This psychological depth makes the characters fascinating and their conflicts credible.
Universal and timeless themes: "The Robbers" deals with themes such as freedom, justice, brotherly love, betrayal and the search for the meaning of life. Schiller focuses on the moral dilemmas of his characters and explores the boundaries of right and wrong in a divided society. These themes are universal and timeless, making the play a work that is still relevant today.
Writing style
Schiller's writing style in "The Robbers" is powerful and expressive. He uses vivid and often poetic language that heightens the emotional intensity of the drama. The dialog is sharp and pointed, often loaded with philosophical and socio-critical reflections. Schiller's ability to translate complex thoughts into dramatic action is particularly remarkable and makes the play both intellectually challenging and emotionally stirring.
Strengths and weaknesses
Strengths: One of the play's greatest strengths is its dramatic intensity. The conflicts between the characters are profound and the plot is rich in twists and turns, making "The Robbers" an exciting and thought-provoking drama. In addition, Schiller's linguistic style provides a rich source for analysis, especially in the context of the Sturm und Drang period.
Weaknesses: However, the high degree of emotionality and the sometimes dramatic tone could be overwhelming for some readers or viewers. The drama may be perceived as too moralizing or didactic, especially in its black and white depiction of good and evil. In addition, the language may be challenging for modern readers as it is very influenced by its historical context.
Recommendations for reader types
"The Robbers" is ideal for readers and viewers who are interested in classic literature, especially 18th century dramatic work. It particularly appeals to those who appreciate in-depth character studies and complex moral issues.
The play is also of great value to students studying German literature, theater studies and philosophical and social-critical issues. It is less suitable for those looking for a light, entertainment-oriented read, as "The Robbers" requires an intensive examination of its themes and language.

In summary, "The Robbers" remains a powerful and provocative work that captivates through its emotional and intellectual challenges, both on stage and in literary analysis. It encourages reflection on human nature and social values and remains a central part of the canon of world literature.
