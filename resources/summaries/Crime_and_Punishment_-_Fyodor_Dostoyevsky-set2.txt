Summary
Rodion Raskolnikov
Rodion Raskolnikov (23 years old) has come to St. Petersburg from the provinces to study law. He does not take part in student activities, avoids everyone and has almost no friends. Six months ago, Rodion left university and gave up his current job completely. He no longer has any income and hates any job. He is in debt and lives on credit. He has been moping around at home for six months without seeing anyone. He has hardly eaten anything for two days. The situation weighs heavily on him. He is gloomy, tense, nervous and suspicious. He has been traveling for months with a sickness in his neck.
Rodion torments himself with a scary plan. Everything has been decided for good. There is no more freedom of will for him, because an irresistible force rules out any contradiction. His judgment darkens, his willpower diminishes and a childlike recklessness takes its place. It overwhelms him like a disease. From a moral point of view, there is no longer any counter-argument. What he has undertaken is not a crime.
The murder of Alyona and Lizaveta Ivanovna
Alyona Ivanovna is a sixty-year-old widow civil servant who mortgages real estate. She gives a quarter of the value and takes five or sometimes seven percent per month. You only have to be one day in arrears and the pledge is forfeited. It is said that this usurer is filthy rich. She lives with Lizaveta Ivanovna, her stepsister of 35 years. She is shy, almost feeble-minded and extremely good-natured. She is treated like a slave by Alyona, has to work for her day and night, gives up all her earnings and even lets her beat her.
A month and a half earlier, Raskolnikov had pawned his sister's ring to her, and the day before that, his father's silver watch. On the day of the crime, he arrives with a new object. When she turns away from him, he strikes her on the head with an axe. Blood gushes out. He begins to fill his pockets with beleaguered objects until he suddenly hears someone come in. Lizaveta stands frozen, staring at her murdered sister. She doesn't have the strength to scream. The axe strikes her directly on the skull. This second murder is unforeseen. Rodion wants to disappear as quickly as possible.
Raskolnikov's article
Raskolnikov goes to the investigating inspector Porfiry to retrieve his pawned items. Porfiry brings up an article by Raskolnikov. Six months earlier, he had written an article "On Crime", which was later published in a magazine. In it, he examines the mental state of the criminal during all phases of the crime and argues that the actual commission of the crime is always accompanied by a pathological state. At the end of the article, he mentions a certain term without explaining it in detail. There are supposed to be individuals in the world who have the right to commit all kinds of crimes and for whom the laws are not written. All people are categorized as either "ordinary" or "extraordinary." Ordinary people must abide by the law, but extraordinary people have the right to commit any crime and break any law.
Raskolnikov explains his thinking further. An extraordinary person grants himself the right to transgress restrictions, but only if this is necessary for the realization of an idea. This may be an idea that is beneficial to humanity as a whole. It does not follow that such a person now has the right to slay the first man. Great legislators and political leaders of mankind, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mohammed and Napoleon Bonaparte, were invariably criminals because they overthrew the old laws and implemented new ideas. Great geniuses who lead humanity to its destiny only occur once in many billions of years. Raskolnikov begins to doubt his actions. How could he take an axe and stain himself with blood?
The pact of the cursed
Sonya Marmeladova (18) prostitutes herself to keep her family afloat because the children are starving. She combines shame with sacred feelings because God gives her everything. Raskolnikov wants to join forces with her. They are both cursed. She has also crossed a line. Rodion pours his heart out to Sonja and confesses to the double murder. Sonja throws herself at his chest and wants to go with him wherever he goes. They both want the other to suffer as much as they do, to suffer together and carry the cross together. The robbery murderer and the prostitute have found each other, the pact of the cursed has been made.
Confession
Raskolnikov struggles to turn himself in to the police. He does not yet want to confess his crime. Finally, he fetches a wooden cross from Sonja and hangs it around his neck, symbolizing that he is now taking up his cross. Rodion runs straight to the police station and confesses to the double murder and the robbery.
Epilogue
At the trial, it is established that the crime must have been committed under the influence of a temporary mental disorder. The perpetrator only received a sentence of eight years' hard labor. Sonja follows the prisoners' section to Siberia. Almost a year and a half after the murder, Raskolnikov finds himself in a Siberian prison. He is gloomy. His conscience can feel no guilt. He feels no remorse for his crime. Rodion falls seriously ill. The disease spreads more and more. The whole world is doomed. Only a few people are chosen. They must create a new humanity and redeem it from sin. Easter is now two weeks away. Rodion is finally declared cured. He throws himself at Sonja's feet. Love has awakened them both. Here begins a new story, the renewal of man, the rebirth.
