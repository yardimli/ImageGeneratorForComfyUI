A Doll’s House
Henrik Ibsen

"A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen is a landmark work of theatrical realism and one of the most influential plays of the 19th century. The play tells the story of Nora Helmer, a seemingly happy wife and mother whose world unravels when a secret from her past threatens to destroy her husband's career and the fragile illusion of their marriage. The play is renowned for its sharp critique of 19th-century marital norms, its exploration of female identity, and its controversial and revolutionary ending.
Summary
In a provincial Norwegian town during Christmas, Nora Helmer appears to be a cheerful, if somewhat frivolous, "doll-wife" to her husband Torvald, a newly promoted bank manager. She delights in their comfortable life and three young children, but secretly harbors a major secret: years earlier, to finance a trip to Italy that saved a gravely ill Torvald's life, she illegally borrowed a large sum of money. She has been secretly working and saving to repay the debt without his knowledge.
Nora's carefully constructed world begins to crack with the arrival of two figures from her past: her old friend, the widowed and pragmatic Mrs. Linde, who is seeking employment, and Nils Krogstad, a low-level employee at Torvald's bank, who is the very man from whom Nora borrowed the money. Torvald, disdainful of Krogstad's past moral failings, plans to fire him and give his position to Mrs. Linde. Desperate, Krogstad confronts Nora and threatens to expose her secret—and the fact that she forged her dying father's signature on the loan document—unless she can persuade Torvald to let him keep his job.
Torvald refuses to reconsider, dismissing Krogstad not only for his past but for his overly familiar manner. Stung by Nora's persistence, he sends Krogstad's dismissal notice immediately. Nora grows increasingly desperate, even contemplating asking for help from the family friend, Dr. Rank, who is secretly in love with her and secretly dying of a hereditary illness. When Dr. Rank confesses his love, Nora realizes she cannot ask him for money. Krogstad, having received his notice, drops a letter detailing Nora's crime into the Helmers' locked mailbox. To prevent Torvald from reading it, Nora distracts him by frantically practicing the tarantella, a fiery dance she is to perform at a costume party the next night.
The following evening, while the Helmers are at the party, Mrs. Linde meets with Krogstad, with whom she once had a romantic relationship. They reconcile, and Krogstad, his bitterness softened by a newfound hope for happiness, offers to retrieve his letter. However, Mrs. Linde insists that the truth must finally be revealed between Nora and Torvald. After the party, Torvald finds Krogstad's letter. He erupts in a fury, not with concern for Nora, but with rage at how her actions have endangered his own reputation. He calls her a hypocrite and a liar and declares her an unfit mother. In the middle of his tirade, a second letter from Krogstad arrives, containing the returned I.O.U. and a note of apology. Instantly relieved, Torvald joyfully declares that he is "saved" and patronizingly forgives Nora, assuming their life can return to normal.
For Nora, however, the "miracle" she had secretly hoped for—that Torvald would lovingly take the blame for her actions—has not happened. Seeing her husband's true, selfish nature for the first time, she undergoes a profound transformation. She changes out of her costume into everyday clothes, confronts Torvald, and explains that she can no longer live in his "doll's house." Realizing she has a duty to herself above her duties as a wife and mother, she returns her wedding ring and leaves the house to discover her own identity and understand the world for herself, leaving a stunned Torvald behind as the door slams shut.
