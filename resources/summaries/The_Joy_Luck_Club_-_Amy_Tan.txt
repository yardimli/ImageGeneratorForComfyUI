The Joy Luck Club
Amy Tan
"The Joy Luck Club" by Amy Tan is a novel where four Chinese mothers and their four Americanized daughters try valiantly—and sometimes successfully—to bridge the deep cultural abyss that separates them. The novel is divided into four sections, with each section featuring interconnected stories from the various characters' perspectives. Through these narratives, Tan explores the complex relationships between mothers and daughters, the challenges of communication across generations and languages, and the search for identity between Chinese heritage and American culture.

Summary
The book opens with a parable about an old woman from Shanghai who buys a swan that was once a duck. She intends to go to America and give the swan to her daughter, hoping the daughter will become "more than what was hoped for." She is left with only a single feather to pass on. The story begins as Suyan Woo has died of a cerebral aneurysm. Her daughter, Jing-mei (June) Woo, takes her mother's place at the Joy Luck Club. In a flashback, Suyan tells Jing-mei varying stories of the club's origins and her flight from China during the Japanese invasion. She finally reveals the truth: she was forced to abandon her twin baby daughters on the road. Jing-mei is stunned to learn she has sisters.

The narrative shifts to the other mothers' pasts. An-mei Hsu recalls being raised by her grandmother, Popo, after her father's death. Her mother had disgraced the family by becoming a concubine. When her mother returns, a pot of hot soup spills on An-mei, leaving a permanent scar, but she learns that both her mother and grandmother are capable of great love. Lindo Jong was betrothed at age two. After her family's home was destroyed in a flood, she went to live with her betrothed’s family. The marriage was never consummated, and Lindo cleverly tricks the family by inventing a dream about the marriage candle being blown out, which signifies disaster. She convinces them that her husband has impregnated a servant girl with imperial blood, allowing Lindo to be dismissed and make her way to America. Ying-ying St. Clair remembers being four years old at the Moon Festival, where she falls into a lake and is separated from her family. She makes a wish to the Moon Lady to be found, a moment that shapes her lifelong search for her own identity.

A second section, introduced by a parable about a mother warning her daughter of the dangers of riding her bicycle out of sight, focuses on the daughters' perspectives. Waverly Jong is a chess prodigy who becomes a national champion by nine. She loves the clear rules of chess but is confused by life's rules and resents her mother Lindo's boasting. She sees her mother as a manipulator, while her mother sees her control as "the art of invisible strength." The conflict leads Waverly to clash with her mother. Lena St. Clair is caught between her insensitive Caucasian father and her mother, Ying-ying, who is descending into a quiet madness. Lena hears the loud but loving fights of their neighbors through the wall and is confused by the lack of communication in her own home. Rose Hsu Jordan recounts a family trip to the beach where she was supposed to watch her brothers and the youngest, Bing, drowns. Her mother, An-mei, loses her faith and uses her Bible to prop up a wobbly table leg. As an adult, Rose is in a failing marriage to Ted Jordan, feeling it is "half and half" and out of balance, much like the table. Jing-mei Woo's mother tries to force her to be a prodigy—first an actress, then a genius, and finally a concert pianist. Lacking talent and desire, June rebels and deliberately performs poorly at a recital, wishing she were dead like her mother's lost twins.

The third part, prefaced by a parable of a mother fearing a mirror at the foot of her daughter's bed will deflect happiness, explores the daughters' adult lives. Lena St. Clair recalls her mother's superstition that every grain of rice she left would result in a pockmark on her future husband's face. This led her to fear a pockmarked neighbor, Arnold, and she becomes bulimic. As an adult, she is in an unbalanced marriage with her husband, Harold, who insists she pay for half of everything despite her having helped build his career. Waverly Jong wants to tell her mother she is marrying her live-in boyfriend, Rich Shields, but is terrified of her mother’s judgment. Having quit chess at 14 because she couldn't bear being ordinary, Waverly is torn between her love for Rich, her complex relationship with her mother, and the pull of Chinese and American cultures. Rose Hsu Jordan is "without wood"—lacking a backbone. As her marriage disintegrates, the beautiful garden her husband Ted once tended goes to seed. Eventually, she finds the strength to stand up to him, realizing she can be a survivor like her mother. At a dinner party, Waverly taunts Jing-mei, who counters with a professional slight. Later, Jing-mei's mother praises her for her humility in not taking the best piece of crab, telling her it is her "best quality."

The final section opens with a parable of a grandmother playing with her granddaughter, hoping the child can retain her hope and laughter even after losing her innocence. The mothers reflect on their pasts. An-mei remembers how her mother, forced to be a concubine after being raped, committed suicide with opium to free An-mei and give her power over her own life. Ying-ying confronts her own past demons of being abandoned by her first husband for an opera singer in China, doing so to liberate her daughter, Lena, from her own stagnant life. Lindo Jong, at the hairstylist with Waverly, reflects on how they both have a "double face," one Chinese and one American, and how they live in two worlds. The novel concludes with Jing-mei and her father, Canning, traveling to China. Canning tells her the full story of how her mother left valuables pinned to the twins' clothes before seeking help. The babies were found and raised by peasants. The story ends as Jing-mei finally meets her long-lost sisters, and a Polaroid snapshot captures the three of them together, all resembling their mother, blending the past with the present.
