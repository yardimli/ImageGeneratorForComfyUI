Summary
Towards the middle of the 18th century, the old and drunken sailor Billy Bones arrives at the "Admiral Benbow", a rural inn near Bristol. He asks the first-person narrator Jim Hawkins, the innkeeper's son, to keep an eye out for the appearance of a one-legged sailor, of whom he is obviously afraid. One night, Bones is visited by another sailor called "Black Dog", who recognizes and confronts Bones as his former shipmate. The two get into a sword fight. Black Dog flees and Bones suffers a stroke. That same night, Jim's father dies.
A few days later, Pew, a blind beggar, appears at the inn and gives Bones a message, "the black spot" (a sign of his disempowerment), whereupon Bones dies of another stroke. That same night, the inn is attacked by Pew and his accomplices. Jim and his mother narrowly escape and take a small package from Bones' sailor's chest, which contains a map to an island where the treasure of the notorious pirate Captain Flint is hidden.
Jim Hawkins presents the map to his fatherly friend, the physician Doctor Livesey, and the lord of the manor and justice of the peace John Trelawney, who decide to set off on an expedition to the island in question, with Jim going along as ship's boy. The expedition ship "Hispaniola" is led by Captain Smollett. Unknowingly, the crew has also recruited several former members of Captain Flint's pirate crew, including the ship's one-legged cook Long John Silver. Jim overhears, hidden in an apple barrel, how the pirates plan to mutiny and assassinate the ship's command after recovering the treasure.
On arrival off the coast of the island, Jim joins the pirates in one of the boats and begins to explore the island on his own. In the process, he meets Ben Gunn, a sailor who was abandoned three years earlier and was also once part of Flint's crew. The situation escalates when the former pirates arm themselves and the skippers are forced to hole up in a fenced log cabin built by Flint. During an attack, some pirates are killed, but the defenders also suffer casualties.
After Jim reaches the blockhouse and tells the Doctor, Squire Trelawney and Captain Smollett about his encounter with Ben Gunn, he leaves again on his own authority. He manages to return to the "Hispaniola" unnoticed, cuts the anchor cables and lets the ship drift away to protect it from the pirates. On the ship, he meets the pirate Israel Hands, who is badly injured after a fight with one of his cronies. Hands initially helps Jim to beach the ship in the northern bay, but then tries to kill Jim with a knife. Jim narrowly escapes, climbs onto the shrouds of the ship and shoots his attacker.
Jim then returns to the island and finds himself walking through the grounds to the log cabin. To his horror, only Silver and his pirates are still there. Silver protects Jim from being killed outright, but risks being removed from office in the process. Surprisingly, Silver then pulls out Flint's treasure map and shows it to the others, whereupon they all set off in search of the hiding place. Jim is tied up and has to accompany the pirates.
On their way, they come across the skeleton of Allardyce, a sailor murdered by Flint, whose outstretched arms point the way to the treasure. To their horror, however, the pirates discover that the treasure has already been recovered. In their anger at Silver and Hawkins, they prepare for a confrontation, but are interrupted by gunfire: The ship's command and Ben Gunn have attacked from ambush. Some of the pirates manage to escape, but Silver stays with Jim. It emerges that Ben Gunn found the skeleton and the treasure during his time on the island and has already taken much of it to safety. This allowed the Doctor to hand over the treasure plan to Silver without hesitation. The expedition members load the treasure onto the "Hispaniola" and start their journey home with Ben Gunn and Silver.
During a stopover on the return journey, Silver manages to escape unnoticed with part of the treasure. Ben Gunn, who witnessed this, remains silent out of fear of Silver. The remaining treasure is shared between the loyal sailors. Gunn later squanders his share in taverns. Jim Hawkins, on the other hand, invests his share in his professional training and swears never to return to the island, even though some of the treasure is still hidden there.
