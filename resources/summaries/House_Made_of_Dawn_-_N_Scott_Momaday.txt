House Made of Dawn
N. Scott Momaday

"House Made of Dawn" by N. Scott Momaday is a seminal work of Native American literature that chronicles the profound spiritual journey of its protagonist, Abel, a young man from the Jemez Pueblo. After returning from service in World War II, Abel finds himself alienated from both his traditional culture and the modern American world. The novel, structured as a circle, follows his difficult path from trauma and dislocation in his ancestral home and the urban landscape of Los Angeles, toward healing and reintegration. Through fragmented narratives, flashbacks, and multiple points of view, Momaday explores the enduring power of language, the necessity of cultural and spiritual balance, and the possibility of rebirth through a return to tradition and the natural world.

Summary
The novel opens with a prologue depicting a lone runner, Abel, in a ceremonial act. The opening word, "Dypaloh," is a Jemez term for starting a story, framing Abel's life as a journey that will come full circle.

The first part, "The Longhair," is set in Walatowa, New Mexico, in 1945. The title refers to a traditional Indian man like Francisco, Abel's grandfather. A man of balance, Francisco is both a Christian sacristan for the local priest, Father Olguin, and a cultural conservative who maintains the old ways. On July 20, he meets Abel at the bus stop upon his return from the war, only to find his grandson disoriented and drunk. Abel's spirit is as sick as his body. Through flashbacks, we learn of significant events from Abel's youth, including his induction into the Eagle Watchers Society. In a disturbing act that foreshadows his spiritual confusion, Abel captures a magnificent eagle only to strangle it, unable to bear the sight of the captured bird. He is also haunted by fragmented memories of the horrors of battle.

Father Olguin suggests Abel take a wood-cutting job for Angela St. John, a sophisticated and manipulative woman from Los Angeles visiting Walatowa for its healing mineral waters. Angela develops a powerful sexual fascination for Abel, whom she fantasizes about in racist terms as a "wooden Indian." The community's life is punctuated by ceremony and conflict. During a festival, a mysterious albino man, Juan Reyes Fragua, bests Abel in a contest, beating him with a rooster. Angela witnesses this and is deeply shaken. Meanwhile, the isolated Father Olguin finds solace in the diary of a predecessor, Fray Nicolas, from the 1880s, seeing parallels between their experiences. Angela's plan to seduce Abel is eventually realized, and they have an affair. The section culminates in a fateful encounter between Abel and the albino man at a bar. In a vacant lot, Abel stabs the albino to death in what is described as a macabre, ritualistic dance, seeing him as an embodiment of evil, a witch or a snake.

Part two, "The Priest of the Sun," moves to Los Angeles in 1952. The "Priest" is John Big Bluff Tosamah, a Kiowa peyote priest who ministers to a group of displaced Native Americans. He delivers a powerful sermon on the biblical phrase "In the beginning was the Word," meditating on the creative and destructive power of language, a central theme of the novel. He condemns Christianity for corrupting language through excessive use. At the same time, Abel awakens on a beach, severely beaten with broken hands. A flashback reveals his trial for killing the albino, where Father Olguin tried to explain that Abel saw his victim as a manifestation of witchcraft. Abel, however, felt he was being disposed of by the white man's language of law. His delirious thoughts turn to the war and to Milly, a kind, earthy social worker who loves him. The narrative returns to Tosamah leading a peyote ceremony, a form of communion for his disciples. In a second sermon, Tosamah recounts the history of his Kiowa people, their glory as horsemen, and their tragic defeat, weaving in the legend of the seven sisters who became the Big Dipper to escape their brother who had turned into a bear at the base of what is now Devil's Tower.

The third part, "The Night Chanter," is narrated in the first person by Ben Benally, a Navajo and Abel's best friend and mentor in Los Angeles. Ben is a "chanter," trained in the long, traditional Navajo ceremonies designed for spiritual and physical healing. He reflects on Abel's departure by train back to Walatowa. His monologue recalls their shared experiences, drinking at a cheap bar and encountering a cruel policeman named Martinez, whom they also call a "culebra" (snake). The night before Abel left, Ben softly sang a healing Navajo chant to him, the "House Made of Dawn." This chant is a poem of restoration, seeking to create balance by invoking elements of the natural world—dawn, evening light, dark clouds, and rain—to restore the body, mind, and spirit. Ben's memories drift between his own pastoral childhood and his time with Abel and Milly, his thoughts colored by the wine he is drinking.

The final part, "The Dawn Runner," returns to Walatowa in the winter of 1952, bringing the story full circle. Francisco is dying. In his final moments, his mind drifts through memories, including a ceremonial dawn race of his youth where he defeated a rival. Abel, now home, tends to his grandfather. After Francisco dies, Abel prepares the body for burial in the traditional way—washing him and braiding his long hair—before waking Father Olguin to arrange the funeral. Then, as the sun begins to rise, Abel strips to his loincloth and joins a few men waiting for the ceremonial dawn race to begin. Startled when they take off, Abel struggles to catch up. He is out of shape and falls in the snow, but he rises and continues on, running alone. In this final, wordless act, he runs in harmony with nature, completing his journey of healing and spiritual rebirth. The book ends with the traditional Jemez closing word, "Qtsedaba."
